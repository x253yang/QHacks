We_Ñéd like to make it clear that while it is devastating to have lost our beloved pet  and this tragedy was obviously completely avoidable  an excessive use of force  and a dangerously negligent act on the behalf of the Officer - we would have found satisfaction in an apology  and for the Wyckoff Police to have told the truth surrounding the circumstances that caused this disaster. Unfortunately  the Wyckoff Police have defended the actions of the officer  assumed no responsibility  conducted no official investigation  and have consistently contradicted the reports of the two eye-witness neighbors  as well as the physical evidence at the scene. Very clearly  they are not being truthful  nor accepting liability for an extreme act of negligence.   **WHAT THE POLICE SAY**  Though the Wyckoff Police Department has not yet released the official police report  we spoke to the police chief on the afternoon of 05/01/2015  and asked if he was sticking to the details that he made public through the media. He confidently confirmed that the details of the police report would be consistent with the statements he made to the media on 04/30/2015.   We are told that while dispatch issued a call to 621 Lawlins Rd.  the officer verbally confirmed the incorrect address  stating _ÑÒ622_Ñù over the radio. He was not corrected. The police maintain that the officer then proceeded down the driveway to the front door of 622 Lawlins Rd.  the Vukobratovic residence. He then supposedly knocked loudly  multiple times - finding no one home  he entered the back yard through the unlocked gate  and proceeded into the yard  around the landscaping  to a the patio area where he discovered an open window. According to the police  the officer considered the window a possible point of entry for what he believed to be a burglary in progress  and drew his weapon. It was at this time that Otto  _ÑÒlunged_Ñù at the officer through the open window  attacking his boot. The officer maintains that the dog _ÑÒhad him_Ñù by the boot  and considered his life to be in danger  which was reason for him to fire four rounds at the dog - two of which missed  the other two hit Otto in his back and side.  After the incident  Animal Control arrived to take Otto to the hospital. No investigation was made on the actual crime scene. The officers who arrived on the scene scoured the yard looking for the casings and bullets from the missed shots. No report was made regarding these ballistics  nor were any photographs taken of the scene. The Wyckoff Police department maintains that the use of force was completely justified  as the dog was violently attacking the Officer  putting his life at risk. Despite this  the officer sustained no injuries. The officer remains in active duty.  **WHAT WITNESSES SAY**  Two adult residents and a child were home mid-afternoon on 04/29/2015. Having just had their windows professionally cleaned  the blinds in their home were open on every window. One of the residents was inspecting the work done on the windows and noticed some unusual damage to one of them  indicating a potential point of entry for what could be a future burglary incident. He called his cleaning service  and they denied causing the damage. Not wanting to create an emergency situation  especially with a child in the home  the resident drove to the Wyckoff Police Department to file an official report regarding the damage. He spoke to an officer at the front desk  and was told a patrolman would be dispatched to his home within the hour.  A short time later  a patrol car pulled onto the street in front of 622 Lawlins Rd.  and both residents of 621 Lawlins Rd. approached the front of the house - one at the window  one at the door. They observed the officer exit the vehicle and proceed down the driveway of 622 Lawlins Rd. There were no cars parked in the driveway of 622 Lawlins Rd.  so the residents of 621 had an unobscured vantage point. Moments later  the officer was observed entering the backyard through the gate. Within seconds  one resident observed Otto coming around the corner of the house  barking at the officer. The officer was then observed taking a _ÑÒstandard shooting position_Ñù and firing multiple times at the dog. The resident observed dirt being kicked into the air from at least one of the shots being fired into the ground. Upon hearing gunshots  one resident left the house  yelling at the officer for being at the wrong address  questioning what he was doing. He raised his hands to his head as a gesture of disbelief regarding his own actions.  **EVIDENCE**  The officer claims he entered the property  came around the side of the house  and observed an open window that he believed was a possible point of entry in relation to this _ÑÒburglary_Ñù call. While inspecting the window  Otto lunged from the window  startling the officer  at which point he fired four times at the dog. This is easily disproven. The eyewitness statements are extremely clear about being able to observe the officer firing at the dog near the gate  nowhere near any open window he could have been alerted to.   On Thursday  04/30/2015 Zana Vukobratovic discovered a bullet casing laying in plain sight on the grass near the gate to their backyard. Officers were called to investigate the casing  but made no photograph of its location  handled it without gloves  and did not thoroughly document the scene.   On Friday  05/01/2015  while walking in the yard  Igor and Chris (his friend)  discovered a bullet embedded in the dirt  approximately 18 feet from the entrance to the backyard. The location of this bullet is supported by the statement of the resident at 621 Lawlins Rd. that saw dirt kicked into the air from one of the shots. Realizing that there could very easily be additional evidence still at the scene  Igor and Chris combed the area  and discovered a bullet casing resting in the leaves  mere inches from the casing recovered on Thursday 04/30/2015.  The photo below demonstrates the likely position of the officer at the time of the shooting based on the location of these three pieces of ballistics:  http://i.imgur.com/iYVJOl9.jpg  As you can see from the below photograph  while standing in this position  the officer would have not had a view of the rear patio area where the open window was supposedly observed:  http://i.imgur.com/xre81Zv.jpg  Here you can see how close the bullet in the dirt was found in relation to the entrance to the backyard. The officer very obviously opened fire within the first few feet of the backyard:  http://i.imgur.com/BKgHuB5.jpg  Below is the undisturbed bullet casing No. 2 that was found on Friday morning  05/01/2015:  http://i.imgur.com/blcnBxa.jpg  **MOVING FORWARD**  At the time of issuing this statement  we have not alerted the Wyckoff Police Department to the discovery of Casing No. 2  or the stray bullet. Quite frankly  we are concerned with their integrity  being that police chief does not seem interested in an official investigation. We have sought legal counsel in regards to charges that may be brought against the Wyckoff Police Department  and have determined that we will be pursuing them for damages  which in accordance to New Jersey law  is limited to the cost of Otto himself  and expenses related to this tragedy. Despite their extreme negligence  excessive use of force  discharging of a firearm in a residential neighborhood  and fabricated police report  the officer will only be held accountable by the department itself. If there is enough support from the community  we may be able to drive the point home that we do not tolerate this kind of irresponsibility on our local police force - nor do we tolerate the fabrication of details in order to protect a wildly negligent officer responsible for needlessly murdering a family pet in its own backyard. It is up to us to hold them accountable.  --------  **Support:**  - Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Justiceforotto  - [Petition (has some typos  Igor didn't make this)](https://www.change.org/p/wyckoff-nj-police-department-fire-officer-kyle-ferreria-for-the-murder-of-otto-the-dog?recruiter=11862285&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=autopublish&amp;utm_term=mob-xs-share_petition-reason_msg&amp;fb_ref=Default) ,conspiracy,2673,01430752185,AgainWithRestarting,Do they have the boot that the dog allegedly bit?,conspiracy,975,01430753593,valtastic,"They haven't responded to any of the accounts  haven't returned phone calls  and have deactivated most relevant email accounts  FB comments  etc.   Edit: They actually just deleted their FB page too.

Anyone feel free to repost this content anywhere you find appropriate:  Governments literally create false realities to keep people in conflict. That is so that populations remain fearful of each other and divided and do not unite to overthrow the elites. It is a part of a strategy of tension that has been employed for at least hundreds of years through governments and probably thousands of years through relgions.  It is not natural for people to hate each other like this. We are manipulated into it. The following is a passage from Howard Zinn's ""A People's History...""  &gt;  Black and white worked together  fraternized together. The very fact that laws had to be passed after a while to forbid such relations indicates the strength of that tendency. In 1661 a law was passed in Virginia that ""in case any English servant shall run away in company of any Negroes"" he would have to give special service for extra years to the master of the runaway Negro. In 1691  Virginia provided for the banishment of any ""white man or woman being free who shall intermarry with a negro  mulatoo  or Indian man or woman bond or free.""  from another section:  &gt;  Bacon's Rebellion brought together groups from the lower classes. White frontiersmen started the uprising because they were angry about the way the colony was being run. Then white servants and black slaves joined the rebelë_ lion. They were angry  too-mostly about the huge gap between rich and poor in Virginia.  &gt;  The greatest fear of wealthy southern planters was that black slaves and poor whites would combine in another uprising like Bacon's Rebellion. One tool to keep blacks and whites from uniting was racism. Edmund Morgan   a historian of slavery in Virginia   wrote in his American Slavery  American Freedom that racism was not a ""natural"" feeling about the differë_ences between black and white. Instead  white leaders encouraged a negative view of blacks. If poor whites felt contempt for African Americans  they were less likely to join with them in rebellion.  It's the same strategy gone global. And now that we have instant global communication  they can't just lie about it in the newspaper and trick everyone. They have to actually act it out or find patsies to act it out for them.  Think about it... do you actually have reason to hate anyone? ....or have you only been taught who you should hate? Do you actually know for certain that the individuals in every ""terrorist act"" are actually who we are told they are? Would the people have actually had the motivation or resources to commit an act of terror or were they only able to do it because a government agency enabled it?  These are all legitimate questions.  http://www.sott.net/article/125878-The-Strategy-of-Tension-NATOs-Secret-War-Against-Europe  &gt; Daniele Ganser  professor of contemporary history at Basel University (Switzerland) and chairman or the ASPO - Switzerland  published a landmark book about ""NATO's Secret Armies."" According to him  during the last 50 years the United States have organized bombings in Western Europe that they have falsely attributed to the left and the extreme left with the purpose of discrediting them in the eyes of their voters. This strategy is still present today  inspiring fear for the Islam and justifying wars on oil.  Tufts Professor  Michael Glennon  even explains this in his book ""National Security and Double Government"". The TL;DR is basically that you don't have any choice or right to self-determination anymore because anything can be justified in the name of ""national security"". http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Glennon-Final.pdf  &gt;  National security policy in the United States has remained largely constant from the Bush Administration to the Obama Administration. This continuity can be explained by the _ÑÒdouble government_Ñù theory of 19th-century scholar of the English Constitution Walter Bagehot. As applied to the United States  Bagehot_Ñés theory suggests that U.S. national security policy is defined by the network of executive officials who manage the departments and agencies responsible for protecting U.S. national security and who  responding to structural incentives embedded in the U.S. political system  operate largely removed from public view and from constitutional constraints. The public believes that the constitutionally-established institutions control national security policy  but that view is mistaken. Judicial review is negligible; congressional oversight is dysfunctional; and presidential control is nominal.  So you saw that video off the Charlie Hebdo thing  right? Here is what I saw. I'm no expert  but I have been putting in a lot of time into reading and learning how these operations work:  I saw a couple of professionals work smoothly and cleanly. They had a very well-planned out attack and made a nice escape. It certainly did not look like a couple of guys who have never seen action and suddenly self-radicalized. Even if you have trained  unless you have seen a lot of action and can control yourself  then you are going to be panicked and scattered. Those guys were smooth and in control.  Not only that  but the big tip-off to me was the leaving behind of the ID cards. This always conveniently happens. Oswald's wallet  James Earl Ray's ""bundle of evidence""  and even the passports that miraculously showed up at 9/11. It's a common tactic because it works so well on the general population and spin control through their agents in the media can discredit those who point out the absurdity.  Now what happened the next day?  Well  a couple of guys took some hostages in a bakery or something. This is where those agents who try to find people willing to become radicals come in. If you had to make something like this happen  what do you do? You probably show them that you can get them money and weapons. You probably use your knowledge of other fake acts by other agents to show them that you are connected to the terrorists. Then you tell them  ""The signal is coming. There will be an attack today  then muslims like us everywhere across Europe will stage a coordinated attack. Your mission will be to hold hostages in this bakery!"" Then they see the attack happen and believe that it is real. These aren't ever really bright people to begin with so they never figure out they are being set up. The reality is those poor patsies would have probably never had a vector to do anything at all if these agencies had never enabled them. Do you think they got those guns by themselves?  Seriously... this is how those types of things operate. You have to create an illusion like a magician. If you go and look at those JTRIG slides  that's exactly what they talk about. These guys love to compare themselves to magicians that create false realities. Examples here: https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/ and here: https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/  I know it sounds like madness  but we have some really famous quotes to back it up:  &gt;  William Casey  CIA Director 1981-1987: _ÑÒWe_Ñéll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false._Ñù  &gt; The aide said that guys like me were ""in what we call the reality-based community "" which he defined as people who ""believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality."" ... ""That's not the way the world really works anymore "" he continued. ""We're an empire now  and when we act  we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality_ÑÓjudiciously  as you will_ÑÓwe'll act again  creating other new realities  which you can study too  and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors ... and you  all of you  will be left to just study what we do."" _ÑÓUnnamed White House aide[1] The quote is now widely attributed to Karl Rove  This is what Karl Rove meant by ""we are history's actor's"". They are literally creating a reality of their own choosing (that of course serves themselves) for the masses to move them to the actions that they want them to.  edit:  Made a TIL post about this today.

OK  so after all that confusing explanation  this is MatPat's proposed timeline:  1. Fredbear's Family Diner Opens 2. Phone Guy kills first child  possesses the Puppet 3. Freddy Fazbear's Pizza 1st location opens- new animatronics Golden Freddy  Golden Bonnie  Bonnie  Chica  and Foxy are introduced. 4. Phone Guy develops killing pattern-using Golden Bonnie suit to lure children to backroom to their death. Kills 5 more victims. 5. Two employees die due to springlock malfunctions in Golden Freddy and Golden Bonnie suits  creating the ghostly Shadow Bonnie and Shadow Freddy. 6. Phone guy pre-records phone calls explaining how to use the springlock suits  both employee deaths incidents  and the missing children incident (FNAF 3 phonecalls). 7. The Puppet  in an attempt to give the children new life  stuff the children's bodies into Freddy  Bonnie  Chica  Foxy  and Golden Freddy suits (FNAF 2 cutscenes from perspective of Freddy animatronic; FNAF 2 GIVE LIFE minigame) 8. 1st Freddy Fazbear's shuts down due to various incidents &amp; foul odors coming off animatronics--saferoom that stores the Springtrap animatronics is permanently sealed off. 9. Grand-reopening of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza at a brand new location. 10. Phone guy kills 5 more victims using a Golden suit  prompting the Puppet to take action and attempt to have the Freddy animatronic to try and kill him (SAVE THEM minigame  FNAF2) 11. Phone guy recordings of FNAF 2 (up until Night 6 call) are pre-recorded during the summertime. 12. An investigation during the summertime occurs looking into the 5 missing children  DOES NOT SHUT DOWN new restaurant.  13. FNAF 2 begins--New Employee Jeremy Fitzgerald takes over night shift in November.  14. Phone guy MAKES PHONE CALL to Jeremy Fitzgerald (not pre-recorded!) on Night 6  explaining someone moved golden suit  that all animatronics are malfuctioning  and that there's a party they have to throw tomorrow. 15. After Night 6  Jeremy is moved to dayshift; new employee Fritz Smith takes over nightshift. 16. During the party  Mangle bites Jeremy Fitzgerald's frontal lobe (Bite of 87); Fritz Smith is fired  for the company believes he's the one who tampered with the animatronics (including Mangle). 17. The Bite of 87 causes the second location to shut down. The older animatronics  which are now deemed safer than the tampered-with newer animatronics  are sent to another location in the hopes of the restaurant one day returning. 18. Restaurant RE-OPENS AT 1ST FREDDY FAZBEAR'S PIZZA location.  19. Phone guy  who now works nightshifts  pre-records all messages for new employees. 20. Shadow Bonnie and Shadow Freddy  having died at this previous restaurant  lead the now-possessed Freddy  Bonnie  Chica  and Foxy to boarded-up saferoom  in an attempt to have Phone Guy dismantle them  releasing their spirits (FNAF 3 in-between night cutscenes). 21. Phone Guy records Night 4 phone recording while running from released spirits of the children. Hides in the Golden Bonnie suit  fails to recognize the wetness of the rained-out room  and dies in the suit as the springlocks malfunction. His spirit possesses it  but no one finds Phone Guy for years due to the room being boarded up. ((FNAF 3 in-between night cutscenes). 22. Because the Phone Guy technically is still around  the children STILL possess each animatronic in hopes to permanently finish the job. (FNAF 3 BAD ENDING) 22. FNAF 1 begins--Mike Schmidt is hired to the nightshift and listens to Phone Guy's pre-recorded messages for instructions. Is caught in the cross-fire of possessed animatronics. 23. Mike Schmidt is fired once it gets noticed that the animatronics are once again malfunctioning (he's blamed for it). Freddy Fazbear's once again shuts down. 24. FNAF 3 BEGINS- Fazbear's Fright opens 25. Phone dude finds Phone Guy's prerecorded messages for springlock suits AND Phoneguy in Golden Bonnie suit (SPRINGTRAP) 26. The puppet returns to the exhibit to finally finish the job. 27. The animatronics spirits are finally at peace and leave the suits once A. All hidden minigames are completed and B. Fazbear's Fright burns to the ground (due to the Puppet)  presumably destroying the Springtrap suit and Phone Guy with it (FNAF3 GOOD ENDING).,fivenightsatfreddys,154,01430998847,rubyeye456,The last two games were rushed because Scott was working with Universal  that's why they didn't look their best.

I totally get how busy some of you are  I hardly have time to sit down for an hour this time of year  and I know you guys have it just as bad or worse  so maybe this is a thing to think about more when summer starts and thinks (hopefully) mellow out for everyone.  When I first joined here  [these](http://i.gyazo.com/ad6992d581812ed5e05c6a4621e51d1e.png) were the mods (also the CSS was icky  props to cryo and raia) and the interacted with the community ALL the time  just on the wayback page there are 2 mod posts (albeit one a daily thread) and another trading post from darkcollector. Keich and Grumpy talked to us a lot  my experience with darkcollector was great  A11 and NotSince posted a lot more then  Cryo was always kind of reclusive I guess  Porygon-bot still sucked. Basically the mod-user interaction happened a lot more than it does now. Going through a few mods history (I know this discounts IRC  but most noobs don't use that Q_Q) I really don't see a lot more than ""don't trade this here."" etc. which is good! that kind of stuff is really important! But I definitely feel like a lot of the camaraderie that used to be here is gone. People don't really use the IRC as much (we've been having dead hour at fucking 8pm est now  wtf)  and overall the friendly atmosphere we had that distinguished us seems to be lacking.  Again  I totally get how busy people are  I'm not try to say everyone should be on the IRC 24/7  or on the DDT hanging out all day  you guys are all really swamped with real life things on top of mod things and i get that. But i feel like interacting with new (and old!) users is as important  or at least nearly as important  as doing flair apps or policing the sub  and there are some mods here that if I didn't look at the mod page I wouldn't even know they existed.   Some of you guys have real life things that are waaaaay more important than the stuff you do here  and I'm not trying to single anyone out at all. This is all just my opinion  and the opinion of the few people I've discussed it with. I think Joels words were ""It's become more of a job"" for the mods  and I think it would be more fun and more enjoyable for both sides if all this rambling shit I wrote was thought over at least a little.

You can all take this how you please. Lets talk about event farming.  It comes down to a something fairly simple we all learned while in grade school: Supply and Demand.  * First let me begin with stuff like Coro Coro Garchomp  PCBCs  PC Scizor/Gengar and Coro Coro Charizard. These events were distrubted in early XY. You had to actually order the Coro Coro magazine in order to get the code for Charizard and Garchomp. Fast Foward to right now. How often do you see Coro Charizards for trade? or better yet  a Coro Garchomp? You don't  because there are very few that exist around this place because **they were not mass farmed**. These hold a very high value. Lets say you have a PC Froakie. Thats a 1 day event in Japan. That should be pretty rare wouldn't you think? Well not really. The time PC Froakie was given out is the time (Japanese) event farming really became a problem. Now lets compare the Froakie to the Coro Coro Garchomp. You were able to get the code for Garchomp for a month or two and the period to redeem the code was also a few months long. So why is this 1 day event less value then what seems to be a fairly easy to obtain code event? There are ~7 total Coro Garchomps on the sub while there are a good 20+ PC Froakie on the sub. I can snap my fingers and have a PC Froakie in front of me in a matter of minutes  depending on what I'm offering of course but for me to find a Coro Garchomp will be much more challanging.   * Now lets see GameStop Diancie. Everyone was so happy that finally NA got an event. Some people couldn't really contain themselves. At the beginning the value of a Diancie Code was about 2-3 shinies  as time went on the value dropped and dropped and dropped. Why? Because instead of taking one or two codes and putting them up for trade  they instead advertised they had 100 codes (I'm not making this up  somebody really did have 100+ Diancie) Fast forward about a month into the distubution of Diancie. You look on the front page and all you see are threads with ""FT: Diancie Codes"".  The value has dropped from a solid 2-3 shinies to 1 shiny. Fast foward a little more  there are EVEN MORE Diancie codes! People are literally giving them away because they don't have the time to redeem themselves. The value of a single Diancie code dropped down to about 1 5IV Breedable. The supply heavily outweighed the demand.  * Hoarding: Some people don't condone this  but it can work into your advantage quite well. The perfect example of this is the Worlds Aegislash. A lot of people are aware that a large group of users from the sub all went to Worlds together with the main goal of farming this event. There are easily 50 Aegislash on this sub that have never seen a trade thread. So why does Aegislash hold such a high value still? There are so many of them! Because the people who farmed/obtained these events did not go on the sub the next day trying to trade them for anything and everything they could get their hands on. Another great example are Walmart Garchomp/Scizor. This event was given by code when you bought a copy of X or Y from Walmart in North America.  North America! There will be tons of these. Wrong! In early XY when these events were active shinies were like gold. You would see a Walmart Garchomp being traded for a mere 2-5 shinies. Something that would never happen today. Fast Foward to now. How often do you see Walmart Garchomp/Scizor for trade? Not very often. The people who grabbed these for super cheap way back in the day held on to them and waited for the DEMAND to rise.  * Now lets look at some events which *should* be rare and valuable  but really arent. Facebook Charizards is the prime example. 2000 codes in total given out  thats a really small number for the whole world right!? A handful of users made duplicate FaceBook accounts in order to get more codes. I know of one person who got 10+ codes just by themselves. So while there are only 2000 codes in the world  but lets say 400 ended up on the sub the challange for you to obtain one becomes very small. Singapore Gengar is another good example. There were 3000 codes total given out IN SINGAPORE (You actually had to be at the venue in Sinagpore to receive code paper) Myself and lots of other users thought this would be out of reach for most of us. On the day of the event 1 code showed up  people went nuts! Then another  then another  then one person had 2 codes  then 3  then 4. You get where I'm going with this. Something that was suppose to be exclusive turned into something mediocore (Mostly cause the NA Gengar was going on at the time  and the only difference was OT/ID so really only hardcore event collectors would care about that)  * /r/pokemonexchange has a very very very big effect on our event values. The amount of people selling on Exchange has tripled even in just the last month or two. I had mentioned earlier in this post that when PC Froakie/Piplup and such were active is when event farming became a real problem. I know of multiple people who got 2-3 sets themselves. Now I'm not going to tell you to not buy  I'm not going to tell you to not sell. I do it myself. Just be aware of what you are doing when asking/farming these events. PC Froakie/Piplup were 1 day each. It theory these should be worth quite a bit. 1 day  In Life  Japanese. In this case there was a very large demand but the supply still outweighed it. Same goes with Coro Rayquaza codes. Sure they are free  and the period that they hand them out is fairly long but when somebody gets 10 codes just for them alone then try to trade them all at once  you're flooding the market. If you go pick up 10 WHF Rayquazas and post a thread looking to trade them all. Same concept. ""Why are my 30 Coro Rayquaza codes worth nothing?""  * In conclusion. The main reason for this post is for the upcomming VGC Pachirisus. I know you're all excited to get your hands on something other then a Wifi Event and even expand your own collection by trading these things. Just remember one thing: Supply and Demand. The more people that farm. the less demand there will be  in turn making the value lower and lower and lower. You're not only screwing yourself out of something good but also screwing your fellow traders. If you want to make the most out of this event/experience don't go and post a thread on exchange offering reservations  don't take 8 of them and put them all for trade at once. Trade your precious rodents for something you want  don't just settle.  Thats all folks. Happy trading!",pokemontrades,16,01430929235,Rodnazics,Oh darn.

Both of these will make the job of the security services much harder.   What this will do is make peaceful non conformists  like myself  look over our shoulders to a far greater degree. As far as I am concerned :-  - I am a pacifist anyway but  even if I were not  I don't think the offensive action by our troops is doing anything to protect our country (quite the opposite).   - I refuse to give to military charities and I refuse to buy or wear a red poppy.   - I also do not support the military propaganda of parades through our streets.   - I don't believe in hereditary privilege so I am a republican. I don't wish the Royals any harm but their position is society is an anachronism in modern society. Most of the tourism is generated by the buildings and these would remain (hopefully run by the national trust).  - I don't demonstrate or seek confrontation but I am perfectly aware that I don't espouse the 'British Values' that Theresa May talks about.   - Essentially  I don't expect other people to necessarily agree with me but I value my right to free speech to be one of the awkward squad.

I work in the sector (for government  so moderately independent) in radiation protection so I get to see the good and bad side of nuclear.  The good is that it generates huge amounts of energy quite cheaply (when averaged out across power produced in its lifetime ""Levelised cost"" or ""LCOE"")  [far cheaper than most fossil fuels and some renewables](http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm). This includes all aspects of building  running  refueling and decommissioning. [It also contributes quite highly to the economy](http://www.nei.org/Master-Document-Folder/Backgrounders/Fact-Sheets/Nuclear-Power-Plants-Contribute-Significantly-to-S) providing job boosts in the surrounding areas. It's rather [safe too](http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/safety-of-nuclear-power-reactors/) as technology and design has improved it to the point where [minimal human interaction is needed in the event of necessary shutdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_nuclear_safety)  which is incredibly useful as most historic accidents have occurred due to human error. Regarding the design of nuclear plants (including safety)  a principle called [ALARP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection#ALARP) is applied to ensure that exposure and risk of failure is kept *as low as reasonably ~~possible~~ practicable*. These highly scrutinised criteria to ensure that the chance of an accident  and impact on public safety  are immeasurably low.  The bad  of course  is that waste can be a problem but [reprocessing](http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Fuel-Recycling/Processing-of-Used-Nuclear-Fuel/) can minimise the amount of actual waste produced  and create fuel sources for other reactor types. We also have the issue of nuclear accidents  but with safety features used in newer reactors  the chance of this happening is astronomically low. At least I hope so because I'd likely be one of the first responders in the event of an emergency! Another ""con"" that is often mentioned is the dwindling source of uranium  but this is a common misconception. Whilst it is true that there is probably only a few hundred years worth of uranium ore left in current mines  the [Japanese were experimenting with extracting naturally occurring uranium from seawater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_mining#Recovery_from_seawater). This would give Earth *billions* of years worth of uranium reserves at current usage rates  and I think the Americans recently made a breakthrough with making this process more efficient.  Overall it is an energy source with pros and cons  but what source doesn't? The pros outweigh the cons significantly in my opinion  with plants being remarkably safe now. It's carbon neutral  has potentially vast amounts of fuel sources  and provides massive amounts of energy for comparatively few sites in comparison to renewable and fossil. Personally I think the world should press on with nuclear to make it a key part of the grid in the next few years or decades  and supplement it with renewables (wind  tidal  solar  hydro  geo)  whilst pumping further funding into renewable technology and nuclear fusion for them to ideally take over grid supply in the longer term.  Sorry if this comment is a bit fragmented  I've written it very quickly during some downtime at work and I've missed out quite a bit. I'm happy to try and answer any questions that anyone might have and expand on things if you're interested  but bear in mind that I'm a relative newbie in the field (15 months) and I am specialised more in the safety and protection of nuclear sites  and accident response to an extent.

The downvote button is important. The problem with this subreddit isn't the existence of a downvote button. I realize it's just a ""trial"" but the entire idea is pointless to begin with.  The beauty of MMOs is that they appeal to gamers of many different unique tastes and preferences. Players can get satisfaction from different things.   * Some players play to collect gear/mounts/minions/titles/achievements  etc... * Some players play to simply become their in-game persona and escape from reality for a little bit. * Some players play to take on the hardest content  and love the intellectual challenge of raiding and min-maxing to push themselves to the limits.  These are just a few common examples from an infinite list of reasons to play FFXIV.  The **REAL** problem with the people on this subreddit (and MMO communities general) is **a lack of respect for players who play this game for different reasons than their own**. People will upvote content that appeals to THEIR specific tastes and they will downvote content that doesn't.   Casual players don't give a shit about hardcores min-maxing their Turn 13 strategy and don't want to see this kind of discussion taking over the subreddit. Meanwhile  hardcore players don't give a shit about commissioned artwork of your scantily clad Miqote.   As a result  content appealing to the smaller demographics get buried  even though it's a very thought-provoking and insightful discussion. Less popular demographics get neglected.  **It has become an ""us vs them"" mentality.** People see players of other demographics as an enemy who threatens THEIR enjoyment of the game  instead of friends who share a common interest. That is the REAL problem. It can't be fixed by tweaking subreddit configurations.  Taking away downvotes doesn't change anything. Popular content rises to the top. Unpopular content sinks to the bottom. Nothing changes except now people can't downvote the TRULY shitty threads like ""Plz tell me y I should buy this game lol"" that truly pollute this subreddit.  Besides  if you really want to downvote someone  you can just click their username and downvote stuff from there. Not very difficult to circumvent.  Leave the downvote alone. The ability to upvote/downvote is what makes Reddit unique and awesome. It allows people to express approval/disapproval. You're attempting to take away people's freedom to express disapproval in an attempt to serve the greater good. You don't have to read very far into your history books to realize why this is a dumb idea. If you want to take the downvote button away from all of us just to silence a few trolls  the trolls have already won.  TL;DR:  * Removing downvotes solves absolutely nothing. It only makes it slightly more inconvenient to downvote things. * Downvoting is important. It allows us to help filter incorrect information  stuff that doesn't contribute to the discussion  and overall useless fluff. * The root of the problem is that players of different demographics don't respect each other. This is a community-wide problem. Removing downvotes does not remove negativity.

These people who are stuck are dumb and should just quit!*  You can't talk about how awesome you are and then talk bad about the general player base in the same point. If you're such an exceptional player  then something like SoF **should** be easy for you. You are not the definition of the average player if you're making comments about how exceptional you are. I think it's safe to assume that SE tracks how players perform on content they release. They wouldn't nerf it if they felt the community as a whole wasn't clearing the content at the rate they were expecting.  *SE is money hungry and just wants people to pre-order Heavensward!*  No shit.

Titan either could have forfeited the last round (and the rest of the game) or forfeited overtime. Saying it isn't a forfeit is just dumb. It would have been much better to acknowledge that it was a forfeit  but turn to rule 22 instead.  At the same time  it was 1v5 and Titan acknowledged that.

Its not their style  blizzard will spend months inhouse tinkering and messing and thinking then they will release a big patch.   IMO its having a negative affect on SC aswell  from playing LOL ive come to appreciate the benefit bi monthly or monthly patches can bring to a competitive game especially one like LOL and HOTS where the meta and game benefit from constant tweaking and growth. But thats not in blizzards nature from my experience i feel they rely too much on big patches developed in house  that sometimes when released are redundant or actually bad because they are always playing catchup to the evolution of the game. In the past its lead to game stagnation  op and broken units going on seesaws from op to nerfed to pointlessness and in game metas reacting accordingly.

However  I find it hard to be grateful to the USSR  and especially to Russia as the successor of the USSR for this victory. Russians like to conveniently set the starting date of the war as June 22  1941 and to portray the conflict with Germany as a defensive war  what they call the *Great Patriotic War.* In reality  however the USSR started in on the action almost at the same time as Germany  when it was still a co-conspirator with Germany in the aggression towards Europe.  My home country of Moldova  or more exactly the region of Bessarabia  was one of the earliest victims of Russian aggression  alongside Finland  Poland  and the Baltic states. After Moldova was forcibly annexed to the USSR  its population was subjected to a brutal wave of repression. My own grandparents in fact came close to being deported to Siberia  although they benefited from an early warning and had a chance to hide during the wave of deportations. They were the lucky ones  many others in my extended family were not. The same personal story is true for millions across Eastern Europe from the families of the officers who were shot at [Katyn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre) to the purging of a large swatch of the intelligentsia of Estonia  Lithuania  and Poland.   Moreover  it's not as though the end of the war inaugurated the onset of peace and prosperity in the region either. No  what followed was yet more misery as the Soviets trapped us behind the Iron Curtain for an additional four decades. In light of these events  it's impossible for me to see the USSR as anything but yet another criminal regime that directly caused the suffering of millions alongside the Nazis. In the clash of the two totalitarian states  Nazi Germany and the Communist Soviet Union  there could be no winning for the states and peoples trapped in-between  just more or less suffering.

(PID)**  **How is it currently?** PID is illegal in Switzerland.  **What would change?**  PID would become legal in one select case: If a couple tries for artificial fertilization  they can screen the implants for genetic diseases. All other PID remains illegal -&gt; no selection for sex  no creation of rescue babies (grow stem-cell donors for siblings).  **Who proposed it?** The federal council.  **What does the parliament say?** The majority supports this amendment. There are two minority arguments against it:    * Principally opposed to PID (long term effects for society  effects for disabled people).  * To make the creation of rescue babies legal as well  **Who opposes the amendment?** Nobody major.  **Will it pass?** Probably.  **2. Scholarship initiative**  **How is it currently?** Scholarships are available through university and cantons. What you get and how much you get depends on where you live.  **What would change?** Harmonise the scholarships. The federal government would determine who would get how  much and then the cantons would pay it. And the scholarships would be increased on average to better support students.  **Who proposed it?** student organisations  **What does the parliament say?** It opposes the initiative  but agrees that the current situation is not satisfying. For this reason the parliament has proposed an alternative solution: They created a law which will sanction cantons (by withholding federal subsidies for scholar ships in that canton)  if they do not uphold the rules laid out in an earlier agreement made by the cantons among each other. This would set the minimal scholarships to 16k. This concordat is currently non-binding. The law will only come into effect if the proposal is rejected.   **Who opposes the amendment?** Government (too much centralization  unnecessary with current situation  additional costs)  **Will it pass?** Probably not.  **3.  Million-Inheritance tax to support welfare state**  **How is it currently?** Currently there is no federal inheritance tax.  **What would change?** A federal inheritance tax would be implemented. Anyone could deduct 2 million from the tax  anything beyond that is taxes 20%. The income of this tax would be used by 2/3 to bolster the social retirement fund (AHV) and 1/3 would be awarded to the cantons. This tax would replace all cantonal inheritance taxes.  **Who proposed it?** Four political parties: SP (socialist democrats)  EVP (evangelical party)  GP (green socialist)  SGB (Swiss Trade Union Association (one of several)).  **Who opposes the amendment?** All the other parties.  **What does the parliament say?** They oppose it  since they believe the cantonal   **Arguments for:** fair and useful  small and medium inheritances are better protected  the parliament has enough wiggle room to protect family businesses  better AHV.  **Arguments against:** More centralization  harder for family business inheritance  not enough to save AHV  no difference in tax for closer relatives  the new law would be applied retro-actively until 2012  weaken Switzerland's stand in the international competition.   **Will it pass?** Probably not. Initiatives from the left opposed by the economy almost never pass.  **4.  Reform for national TV/Radio**  **How is it currently?** If you own a TV/Radio you have to pay a fee. This fee is collected by Billag  one of the most disliked/hated companies in Switzerland. The fee is 462 CHF annually.  **What would change?** The fee would be replaced by an universal  but lower fee. Every house-hold would have to pay 400 CHF a year. Additionally corporations with a yearly revenue of 500'000 and more would have to pay a fee as well.  **Who proposed it?** This is a law that was created by the federal council and passed by both parliaments. Now a group of people has gathered 50'000 signatures for a referendum against the law.  **Who opposes the law?** A bunch of people (mostly centre liberal business types)  **What does the parliament say?** Is in support since the current situation is bad and outdated.   **Arguments for:** Current system is outdated and with a lot of administrative cost. New system is simpler: Everyone pays. Lower fee. Nobody watches national TV illegally anymore.  **Arguments against:** Corporations pay double. The public service is not accurately defined the fee goes towards funding bullshit TV. No longer a fee but a tax. The federal council can adjust the number without having to change the law.  **Will it pass?** Probably.

Step by step this is how the business plan would look like:  Research phase:  1. First of all go to local hardware shops in your area - slightly higher quality ones and also if possible try and speak to builders / real estate construction guys to see if there's a market for these more premium door handles in your city.  2. Try to get a feel for what some of these ""premium"" brass door handles look like and how they are different from the Rs. 200 - 500 bracket regular door handles or aldrops. You will develop an eye for this over time as you browse competitor websites and supplier images etc. For eg www.victorylocks.com http://www.dorsetindia.com/ - For suppliers go to www.alibaba.com and type ""brass door handles"" or ""pull handles""  3. Learn about the different categories of these door handles which are mainly: Pull Handles (used in offices / restaurants on glass doors usually)  Mortice Handles (used in homes and the biggest seller)  Handle on Rose (horizontal handles)  Handle on Plate (vertical handles)  Main Door Handle (larger designer pull handles used in premium / rich class homes for their main door)  Once you have done this research and feel comfortable knowing the product type and can tell what is a ""premium"" door handle and what is a regular one  you will have a good idea of what kind of handles to source from your supplier. To make things simple just try and copy the inventory of this guy: www.decolocks.com  Business Set Up phase  1. Decide a brand name  logo and all that jazz. ""Diamond Locks"" or whatever you like. Set up a cheap website for now just to make the brand appear legit and established.  2. Get this business registered as a private limited company - nobody will take you seriously if you go to clients offices accepting payments in your personal savings account. ;) There are sites that offer this whole pvt. ltd registration service at like Rs 5 000 to Rs 10 000 - get it done.  3. You should already have an idea of a few good suppliers from Alibaba.com but now is the time when you really need to lock on one supplier and finalize a ""sample order"". Here's one that I use: laotongjiang.en.alibaba.com / http://laotongjiang.en.alibaba.com/productgrouplist-222097622/Brass_Door_Handles.html  4. Finalize your first import order from China - this is more like a ""sample"" order to get your business started. Choose like 10 to 20 different door handle designs you want to  sell initially and order 10 sets of each. This is going to be the biggest start up expense and this first sample order will cost you around 2 lacs more or less.  5. Google for a ""freight forwarder"" or similar company in India. Here's one I use: http://www.seatransmovers.com/ These guys take all the hassle out of importing and will take care of all the paper work etc and import the door handles safely for you from China.   - Just a word of advice: Importing from China is a bit of a skill in itself  negotiation etc matters a bit and you will learn this along the way.   My friend's dad barely knows any English but he is a damn good negotiator and knows Chinese people like the back of his hand by now. Remember  as the buyer YOU are in power and these Chinese exporters will be eager to please you as long as you appear like a ""big"" guy to them. Promise big orders in the future etc.  - Once the first lot of door handles from China arrives  get your product catalog printed and also product packaging with your own branding printed. This is more important than you think. You want to really invest in a very premium looking product catalog / brochure because this is what your clients will see in meetings for the first time. Also your product packaging must look good.  The catalog has pictures of all of your door handles that you just imported from China and things like a company profile page etc all presented as beautifully as possible. The catalog should feel like you are a million dollar company manufacturing brass door handles in a big facility somewhere in your town.  The whole premise of this business is appearing like a legit manufacturer of premium brass door handles and not letting clients know the fact you import them from China. This is not cheating or anything  its just how white label brands operate. Karbonn Mobile etc all are basically doing the same thing in a different industry.  - Once your catalog  business card etc is ready - its time to step into the battle field. Either you personally or you and some friends act as salespersons for your own firm  visit hardware shops  hardware dealers / distributors / wholesalers - offer them sample pieces  give them your catalog - meet with them - tell them you manufacture premium brass door handles for high end apartments  buildings  offices  hospitals etc.  This is the most crucial step of this entire operation and I could write an essay on this step alone but you get the idea... you have to go out there and do the sales.. build customers  give them free sample pieces if you have to.  This product does sell fast - once you build customers you will just grow naturally from there.  So to sum it up:  1. Research your local door handle market 2. Set up business legally as a pvt ltd firm  get logo  catalog and shit done 3. Import first set of door handles from Chinese supplier. 4. Repackage these door handles into your own branded boxes. 5. Go out there and meet with builders  real estate guys  construction guys  hardware shops  hardware distributors etc - in short the SALES part.",india,185,11431490228,rcha,Not sure why Many Indians are not aware of it. 1971 war is almost led to WW3  .people should reading more these kind of wars where geopolitics and true colors of some nations is on display . ,india,189,01431500811,RajaRajaC,Ok and?

Both cost money. There is a common argument against renting that somehow renting is ""throwing money away"" and that paying a mortgage is all about building up equity.   First  a mortgage payment is heavily skewed to the interest portion in the beginning part of your mortgage. So if you get a 30 year mortgage and plan to move in a few years  there will be little to no build up of equity through mortgage payments. And with most Americans moving every 6-8 years  there is a high chance that you will not have the time to build up that equity. Then there is also the fact that all of the other costs associated with owning a house - property taxes  insurance  repairs  normal maintenance  emergency fixes  etc - is not going to build up equity and is also being ""thrown away"" in the sense of no capital buildup. Even things like needing new appliances are not going to raise the value of your house much  because a normal home buyer expects there to be working appliances and would simply discount your house if there were none.   However  it still may be cheaper to buy a place and set aside enough money each month to pay for the extra costs of repairs  maintenance  property taxes  etc than it is to rent. The opposite may also be true. You can check out the [NY Times Buy Vs Rent tool](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) and play with the factors including property prices  rent prices  length of time in home  interest rates  downpayment  etc. It will take into account opportunity costs - the ability to have used the money you would put towards the house to other investment opportunities. This is often where the calculus tips towards renting.  Another reason we often advise people who come here to rent is because of other financial stress. If you don't have a proper emergency fund  you are setting yourself up for financial stress and failure. There is no more landlord to fix the main pipe that burst so you need to be prepared to deal with that. If you don't even have a downpayment  where you will be able to get the money to replace the roof? Obviously not through a HELOC and if you can't save before buying a house  it is likely you won't be able to save after buying a house.  There are other reasons as well  including the need for mobility and expected upcoming life changes. Tying yourself down at a time when you need the flexibility to up and move for that amazing career opportunity is self-sabotage.  The short version is that it may be financially imprudent to buy a house because of the rent versus buy calculations  capital requirements  or lifestyle choices.  Now onto the car argument. If you buy a used car or if you lease a new car you are getting the same good  namely transportation. That is where the comparison with housing stops. Because after 3 years with a lease  you turn it in and get another  larger payment for a new lease (inflation and all). Rinse and repeat forever. Now with a used car  once you pay it off  it is yours. Since you can pay off a used car in a usually short amount of time and the car should still have many years of life  you drive around sans car payment for quite a while  which you will never do while leasing. A used car has gone through the largest depreciation period already and will hold its value much better.   With a lease - always have a car payment. With a used car - get to car payment free rather quickly.  Now  if we are talking about new cars  the numbers change. Some people will always want a new car. If your plan is to buy a new car every three years or so  then lease.

I never heard of it before but it does make sense.   *Someone care to explain how I'm wrong? ,personalfinance,-61,01431693990,AcquaPiovana,"I hope I don't get buried.  Former bank employee  current financial worker  and former homeless  street rat here.  I hope I can help.  1) You need ID.  Do you have a current photo ID?  If not  please get one.  Have a secondary form of ID  too  if possible.  Birth certificate  SSN card  anything govt issued.  2) If you're unsure how much debt is taxes or city/government-based  I would advise *against* putting this check in a bank under your identity.  The account could get frozen in as few as two business days  and you will probably never see that money again.  3) It is difficult (near impossible) to cash a check of that amount if you're not a current account holder at any bank  even with proper ID.  You can definitely try to cash it at the bank it's drawn on  but make sure you have ID up the wazoo  and a small branch may ask you to come back another day if they don't have the reserves to give out that much at one time.  Also  you then have the issue of where the F to put this money.  This might sound crazy  but if you do successfully get this money in cash  you might want an old fashioned suitcase-type thing with a combo lock.  I think Staples sells stuff like this.  4) I would advise that you then flip the money into a cashier's check made out to yourself  but this gets messy too  as many banks have fraud policies in place that state they only draft bank checks for customers.  As previously stated  you probably don't (and shouldn't) have a bank account in your name at this time.  5) Do you have someone in your life you trust  infinitely?  You mention signing it over to someone else.  This is potentially the best option  as long as the person helping you is the most trustworthy person known to man.  You are  almost literally  trusting them with your life.    What you would do is: accompany this friend/family member to *their* bank (not the bank the check is drawn on).  Walk up to a teller together.  Present ID.  State that you are endorsing the check over to the other person  and he/she is depositing it in their bank account.  The fact that you're *there* will alleviate any red flags for the teller  who is almost definitely not going to find any of this sketchy or throw up alarm bells.  It would be different if you *weren't* there  and this account holder showed up trying to deposit a $20k check in someone else's name which was simply double endorsed.  That could result in extended holds  and research.  Then  wait for the funds to be verified by the bank and the money to become available.  (Side note: I hope this friend of yours banks at a big bank like B of A  because this will make things easier for you down the road... *edit for clarity* if you're leaving town  I mean... having checks for a small three-location bank will be almost just as useless as your huge check  if you leave the area).  THEN I would go back to the bank and have this friend request a series of bank checks in your name  then give you a certain amount in cash (a couple thousand?).  The bank checks keep your money safe while giving you control.  If lost  they can be replaced (keep the carbon receipts!!!).  They can't be cashed by anyone else.  You may also want to drop some money onto a pre-paid master card  which visually resembles and operates like a debit card.  You *DON'T* need to supply visa/mastercard/amex with your SSN in order to maintain one of these types of cards.  Be warned: this type of money-movement will result in paying fees.  There will be fees to get the checks in the first place  fees to cash them later if you're not an account holder  and fees to maintain one of those silly pre-paid cards.  But these are your limitations in going off the grid.  6) As someone else said  I would get the F out of NYC  as your money will last longer elsewhere.  Like  almost anywhere else you go.  Pre-paid rent (though ill-advised by someone else) might be required since you don't have proof of a job or references  probably.  But see if you can pre-pay for as little as possible.  Three months?  Five months?  7) Be frugal with anything you buy  because this amount of money can seem like a lot  but will go fast.  Buy used stuff  get a small apartment  eat at cheap places  conservative cell phone plan  etc.    8) While still keeping your working money (the $20k) off the grid  once you're established somewhere  begin contacting lenders and saying you are ready and willing to make some arrangements  but you still have no job.  Make sure you have a mailing address and email account to keep in contact with them to keep your promises.    9) Enjoy the job search.  Waiting tables might be good?  Data entry?  Again  I would consider something outside of NYC (possibly out of NY entirely  to get as much lag-time on city-based debt as possible).    Most of all: good luck.  *edit:* I didn't expect so many kind words towards me  of all people.  Thanks reddit  you're cool today.  I want to add one more thing:  I didn't strongly address the addiction or mention rehab for a few reasons.  But overall  I'm giving OP the benefit of the doubt because the post suggests a conscientious move towards changing his/her life and taking control.  I agree that getting a fist full of cash as an addict is not the best idea  and my post is not meant to advocate that.  I wanted to give realistic solutions to put this money in the hands of the person it belongs to to improve his/her life  because I know what it's like to be at the bottom and feel like  even when good stuff happens to you  you get roadblocked at every turn.  Therefore  if /u/cantcountnoaccount has the correct info about a Bellevue detox and 28 day rehab having no up-front cost  then **DO IT**.  Checks don't typically go stale (""expire"" for lack of a better word) in a month  but OP should definitely check any clause on the check that states ""valid for ____ days"" or the like.  Some checks have clauses as few as 90 days.  If the check does not explicitly state that it goes stale in a set amount of time  the general rule is 1 year for a ""corporate"" or company check  and 6 months for a personal check.

Or you can go to the probate court and see if they have volunteer attorneys who handle these matters. 1. it is true that you are not liable for any debts of your mother.  Your mother's estate will be liable for her debts.  Do not sign any paperwork that has anything regarding your financial liability.  Do not agree to undertake any of the costs of your mother's treatment.   2.  Get yourself to a social security office and apply for benefits if your sister is still a minor. 3. Essentially the debts for your mother's hospital stay will be wiped in the estate.  It's too late to apply for COBRA benefits as someone else suggested.  See if the hospital has a financial ombudsman  but don't sign any paperwork unless you have an attorney review it first.   3.Credit card companies  and many utilities have debt forgiveness programs  but unless you are a co-signor on any of your Mother's debts they can only collect against the assets of the Estate anyway. Also  these programs are run by particular departments/individuals within each organization  so the average customer service representative is just wasting your time.    4. If you don't have access to funds to hire an attorney  you can try to probate the estate yourself.  There is a learning curve  but its not impossible  or for that matter particularly difficult.  The difficulty lies in not understanding the terminology and the process  not some secret law tricks only lawyers have access to.  There are many law books and help from webpages you can research.   5. Many districts have statutory fees that a lawyer can receive for probating an estate.  You should find out what fees are normal in your area before you agree to be represented. 6.  If you and your sister are living in your mother's home you want to prioritize payment of the mortgage and utilities.  It is very hard to get out from under foreclosure proceedings  and much more costly in the long run to let those bills fall to the estate's responsibility and have to dig your way out  than it is to maintain the status quo  if possible.  Also paying the household bills is arguably a ""loan"" to the estate  which also makes you a creditor to the estate.  Therefore  keep meticulous records of any expenses you do pay.   7.Never pay the credit card debts  they are unsecured  and sit at the bottom of the debts paid out by the probate court.  Ignore all the hospital bills (they'll be coming several months after the hospital stay)  except as a debt of the Estate.   8.  In my state  debts of the estate are paid as follows: Funeral Bill  Attorney's fees  Fiduciary fees (the executor gets paid for his work)  Taxes  Secured creditors  unsecured creditors  heirs  9. It is possible you will be forced to sell the house to settle the estate if there is not enough cash/assets to pay the debts.  Don't let that freak you out at the moment.  In my state the court has a nine month window from the opening of an estate to the closing  and that window can be extended many times.   If you are in the situation where the house is at risk of being sold in order to settle the estate  and you and your sister are staying at the house  then worry the more about maintaining your own good credit than paying the mortgage.   10. Call the pension administrator.  There may be terms under the pension for this situation that will allow it to transfer to you or your sister.  There may be a death payout that would help you over the hump. 11.  When dealing with any institution do not leave them an original death certificate unless they require it.  Always ask them to keep a copy of your certificate instead.  Get at least 3 but no more than 5 copies of the certified death certificate when you first get them.  Usually the funeral home will ask you how many copies you want.  Later  if you need more copies you will go to the appropriate agency to get them (city hall  probate court  it differs from place to place)  9edit commas for clarity  additional advice)  Sorry for your loss  I hope some of my information helps you out.",personalfinance,3250,31432758215,strugglingcomic,Very  very sorry for your loss. I offer you my condolences  but since you are here  I think you are more interested in practical advice.  1) Try to stay as calm as you can. Since you are in charge of finances  you should be aware of any and all outstanding debts and obligations  as well as assets. Being able to evaluate your situation calmly and logically will be invaluable to you and your children. Do not make any rash decisions now (i.e. don't try to sell your house immediately or something like that).  2) Your top and immediate focus is on the basic necessities. You need a roof over your heads  food on the table  and to handle funeral expenses  that sort of thing. Do not worry about making investments or even reporting income for taxes just yet. You still have many months to work out those details later. Whatever money you have coming to you in the next few weeks  park it in your savings accounts and don't touch it for anything other than absolute necessities. Pay your rent or mortgage on time  pay your utilities  get the groceries  and pay off or minimize your high interest debts.   3) Make sure you have a support network for you and your children  relatives or close friends who you trust absolutely and who you can delegate some tasks to. Don't be afraid to reach out for help  including professional help such as a grief counselor or therapist for you and your children. Your mental and emotional well being is just as important (if not more so) as your financial well-being.  4) A few months down the road  sit down and plan out more of your financial future. Either hire an accountant or do some research about how you plan to use the money available to you  and what your tax obligations look like. But you do not have to worry about this right now  you seem to be in decent shape financially and should be fine to put your finances into a holding pattern for the next few months. But keep in mind  you will need to find stable full-time employment by then as well  once you feel ready for it.   I know my words must seem tiny and insignificant compared to what you're facing right now. But please understand that you are not helpless  you can do this  and you can take care of your family going forward. It won't be easy  and of course it won't be the same  but it is far from hopeless or insurmountable. Take it all at your own pace: one breath  one step  one day at a time.,personalfinance,2635,41432833473,HerpDeeps,"File a police report.

King Gill  to suit up and play if needed.  Gill didn't have to play  but this was the start of the **12th Man Tradition** that A&amp;M is so proud of.  Almost a century ago  students at A&amp;M started standing up for the entire game ... not because they couldn't see  or it was a particularly interesting part of the game  but because the students were showing the coach and the team that they were all ready to go down  suit up and play on the team if needed.

The ""oh  we stay at each other's places pretty much every night!"" is NOT the same. You still have your own place as sanctuary to run off to if need be. When you move in together you don't have that any more. You learn so much about someone when you have no choice but to interact with them every single day. You learn that he hates when you leave your makeup piled up on the counter  you hate that he floods that bathroom when he takes a shower. Rather than accepting it as  ""well  it's their place""  it forces you to have open communication about the things that bother you. You really have to work as a team and learn how to make life easier on one another. Some people are great at making that transition  while others find that they're simply incompatible with their partners. I personally think it's necessary.

I went to The Salty Suite before Bam 7  in Melbourne  Australia the thursday before the tourney. Mango  Chillin  Leffen  S2J  Lucky  Alex19  Hugs Wife  and all the Australian Smashers. The Place is in a cool bar looking place.Everyone was having fun  people were drinking( I dont drink) and people played smash. There was this girl from the area I met there and she was hanging out with Me and and some others. Afterwards  we went to another Bar called ""Abc"" just to chill  SD  Skeletom  and about 10-12 others were with us also. Mango Hugs  and some others met up with us a little later. The Girl that was with us was drinking some Tequila drinks. (She had 4 in total) She wanted more drinks but I said you should probably stop and she did. We then were all walking around the CBD in Australia(The City of Melbourne) looking for more places to go to. We finally found some place and by this time it was about 1-2am in the morning. I think their was about 12-15 of us give or take in the place. We were at that place for about 30 minutes or so until it closed. The trains at this time were closed and I asked Reef(the Australian Smasher I was with) if he could give her a ride to her car. She parked it at a train station about 10-15 minutes away. Reef being cool said yes and he drove her. In the Car it was Reef  driving  Nathan  in the passenger seat  and the Girl and I in the back seat. Both of our seat belts were on but we were holding hands and kinda cuddled up. We finally get to her car about 10-15 minutes and we part ways. the Girl and I planned to meet up at the Pm tourney they were having the next day. The next day came and I entered Pm doubles and Singles( I took leffen's spot since he didnt show up) The girl never showed up but messaged me and said she was going to come later to watch the top 8.  Top 8 was at a different venue  it was at the Bam 7 venue. So I finally get there and play some melee friendlies with Australian's best and even play Spud from New Zealand( That guy is amazing) The Girl finally shows up and I asked her  how she was and if she remembered everything from last night since she was Intoxicated a bit. She sad bits and pieces I said ok and she said she doesnt want to get drunk like that again. After that  interaction I sat down to watch Pm Top 8 and  started to get tired. So I walked over to the fgc side of the venue  and went to sleep on a couch for about 30 minutes or so. Someone woke me up and said they are calling you to the front.So I went to the front and Redact asked me to step outside to talk to me about something.He asked if I  remember the Girl from last night. He then said that she said I was being inappropriate in the car ride when I asked what was said he said he didnt want to repeat. He then said that he didnt know what was true or not but that fact is that she told us she doesnt feel comfortable with you here and we made the decision to not let you attend Bam 7 and you will be getting a refund.   I was frustrated because it was words of a Girl(she is 26 btw) that was intoxicated the night before and doesnt even remember all that happened and I was with all those people . I dont take advantage of Drunk Girls and now i had to watch Bam 7 not attend it. I know some might not like me in this thread and yes I had some Issues many years ago in the smash community but all of those were resolved.

Because I know how Joss feels about women  and I know that he's made it a point to create strong female characters. I think part of the problem is that people are frustrated that they want to see more women  doing more things  in superhero movies  and because we don't have as many women as we should yet  they're very  very sensitive to every single storyline that comes up right now. But I think what's beautiful about what Joss did with Black Widow - I don't think he makes her any weaker  he just brings this idea of love to a superhero  and I think that's beautiful.  If anything  Black Widow is much stronger than Banner. She protects him. She does her job  and basically they begin to have a relationship as friends  and I think it's a misplaced anger. I think that what people might really be upset about is the fact that we need more superhuman women. The guys can do anything  they can have love affairs  they can be weak or strong and nobody raises an eyebrow. But when we do that with a woman  because there are so few storylines for women  we become hyper-critical of every single move that we make because there's not much else to compare it to.  So I know Joss really well. I know what his values are. And I think it's sad  because in a lot of ways  there haven't been as many champions in this universe as Joss *is* and will continue to be. And I know it hurts him. I know it's heavy on him. And the guy's one of the sweetest  best guys  and I know him - as far as any man can be a champion for women  he is that.  So it's been a little disheartening.   But I also see how much people love that aspect of it. There's an equal amount of people who find the love interest between Banner and Black Widow to be a big standout. And it's very satisfying to people. So it's a movie. People are going to have their opinions. And that's actually a great thing. The fact that this is a debate that's coming out of this movie is probably a positive thing.  I just don't think that people should get personal with Joss  because he really is - of anyone - an advocate for women. He's a deeply committed feminist. ,IAmA,5427,21431015959,CarollSpinney,"Okay  here's one.  This is a very sad story  but it's real.  I got a letter from a fan who said his little boy  who was 5 years old  his name was Joey  he was dying of cancer.  And he was so ill  the little boy knew he was dying.  So the man  in his letter  asked if I would call the little boy. He said the only thing that cheered him at all in his fading state was to see Big Bird on television.  So once in a while  he wouldn't see Big Bird on some days  because he wasn't necessarily in every show. So he asked could I telephone him  and talk to the boy  tell him what a good boy he's been.  So I took a while to look up a phone  because this was before cell phones. And they got a long cord to bring a phone to the boy.  And I had Big Bird say ""*Hello! Hello Joey! It's me  Big Bird!""*  So he said ""Is it really you  Big Bird?""  *""Yes  it is.""*  I chatted a while with him  about ten minutes  and he said ""I'm glad you're my friend Big Bird.""  And I said *""I'd better let you go now.""*  He said ""Thank you for calling me Big Bird. You're my friend. You make me happy.""  And it turns out that his father and mother were sitting with him when the phone call came. And he was very  very ill that day. And they called the parents in  because they weren't sure how long he'd last.  And so his father wrote to me right away  and said ""Thank you  thank you"" - he hadn't seen him smile since October  and this was in March - and when the phone was hung up  he said ""Big Bird called me! He's my friend.""  And he closed his eyes. And he passed away.  And I could see that what I say to children can be very important.  And he said ""We haven't seen our little boy smile in MONTHS.

Let me start at the beginning:  On sunday my brother called me to tell me about a magazine's Facebook post with our video that had gone viral. It had 2.5 million views. Unfortunately  the magazine had ripped our video and made it a Facebook video. To make things worse they edited out our name from the beginning of the video.  Also the post only linked to their website. They [Mentioned](http://i.imgur.com/JgBWAoJ.jpg?1) our band name and Neal Ungers but it was done in weird/ semi-insulting way and along with a bunch of other names of a video they were trying to promote. There was no linking to us. They were trying to funnel people to one of their own videos. Then I started to look at the comments. There were tons of people asking who the band was? What was the song? etc.  It was Sunday and Mothers Day. It took around 20 minutes to get a hold of my bandmates and our manager. We were shocked and confused. Awesome that this is getting so much attention but sickening to see none of it connecting to us. We sent emails  Facebook messages  made calls. Did everything we could to ask the magazine to link to us and the real video. We asked our label for help. After finally getting a hold of them they told us that there was nothing to be done and we could talk more about it on Monday. Meanwhile  in the time it took to get a hold of our label the post had gained 200 000 more views (about 50min). I was really upset. No matter what we said we kept being told there was nothing we could do and to just be grateful for the exposure. At this point our actual youtube video had around 7k views but this magazine's video had 2.7 million.  I think this may be a good time to elaborate a little more on what it means to be on a Label like ours:  Don't get me wrong. We love our label (Elektra)! And we are overjoyed that they believe in us enough to sign us. But when you're on this kind of label you are one of many bands on their roster. If you are not performing well they don't want to put any more work into you than they have to. Especially on a sunday that happens to be Mothers day. And if you are a new band (like us) that has very little track record and doesn't have lots of sales things get even grimmer. We are very low on the totem pole. The other fact of being on a Label like ours is that you still have to do most everything yourself. Promotion  tours  posters  videos  anything you can think of. Ask any band you know thats on a label. Some might believe in the glamorous idea of a Label signing a band and suddenly all your problems are solved and you get big. The truth  however  can be seen when you look at label roster and see how many bands you've never heard of. The vast majority of bands that sign to a label never go anywhere. A good example of our influence is this video. We shot it with favors. We paid the talent and we paid for the locations and that was about it. Everyone else volunteered cause they are our friends. Supposedly  15 years ago there used to be budgets for videos in the music world.   This brings me back to our predicament. Sunday. Our video had 2.7 million views but no one was connecting it to us. And we couldn't get anyone to do anything about it (magazine or label).   My bandmates and I tried posting our youtube link in the comment section of the illegitimate post. But we all got blocked fairly quickly by Facebook. You can only do that so many times.  Thats when i thought maybe i should ask for help from reddit.   (I've been addicted to reddit for almost two years now. I never sign in though. I just like to read. I made an account 5 days ago because I thought about posting our music video. But i didn't.)  So I posted to reddit. The response was amazing. People we're giving great legal advice and instructions on how to best approach the magazine. People started posting the original link of our video on the illegitimate Facebook post. Others who had experienced similar things told us their stories. I saw one comment that a redditor had uploaded our video as a new post. And for the record no one in my band knows that user. None of us asked anyone to do that or any other related posts. Reddit was incredible. We were ecstatic.  Then late at night when the video was around 4 million views the magazine responded. We didn't want them to take it down. We just wanted proper credit. However  they took it down before contacting us and said it was all a mistake. They made a couple edits of their apology. One that said our video was three years old (its days old). And one that said they accidentally posted someone's re-editäó_ Not sure what to make of that.  Then it got late and I fell asleep.   Next morning I woke up to find my post had been removed by the Moderators. When I asked why they said because of vote gaming. They also said they removed all posts related to it for the same reasons. Other than that they wouldn't respond to me.  Then we were told reddit wanted to an AMA with us in the afternoon. So we got together and answered questions.  This is where i need to explain that we come from a really tight music scene. Provo  UT has lots of amazing bands. Neon Trees  Imagine Dragons  Joshua James  Desert Noises  Fictionist etc. Its our hometown. Everyone is very supportive and protective of each other. Also we have lots of fans and friends. When people heard we were doing an AMA i believe many of them wanted to join in. After things started to get controversial some of these fans/friends (this is my guess) started diving in. This is where etiquette was breached. We asked no one to defend us or upvote or downvote posts. I found out about one commenter I personally knew when he started getting belligerent. Someone texted me about it. I asked him to stop. He did. Wish i could've stopped more.  After the AMA we got some food and went to set up for a show we were playing. During the course of the show we saw that our AMA was going crazy. All our responses were downvoted. We already responded to the list of why this is a conspiracy at the beginning of the AMA. Item by Item. Not sure why someone had to copy the question again and leave our answer out. Also not sure why we would want to pull a stunt like this on a Game of Thrones/Mothers Day -- sunday night  Anyway  this is way too much information. If you read this thank you. I know it seems crazy. But this is what happened. I just wanted to get it out there and be transparent. We really appreciate the support reddit gave us.  **TL;DR**  Ripped FB video - 4.5 million  Our actual youtube video - 390k  Conspiracy theory - win  Actual events - lose   Reddit - Amazing ,IAmA,-334,21431437270,MN_SPORTS_FAN,Only if the test is fucking useless.

Considering how much you exploit your photographers and pay them absolute shit (~200 for ~60 images FULL OWNERSHIP!) for the amount of work required and amount of money SG profits from them?? That's not even including the Member Review loophole where they get paid NOTHING and still have restrictions on their own photos!   Do you think it's fair to pay photographers only ~$200 (""maybe"" that's not even definite!!) for the amount of work required to go into a submission set?        If you add up the amount of hours it takes to shoot  edit  prepare  etc. a SG set that's less than minimum wage. You're literally saying that  let's say it's only 30 photos  that they are worth $6 each. How is that not insulting? And that's for FULL ownership! Not even a limited license!  I'm curious  since you require each photo to be delivered in hi-res  since you will also be using it in other media  if you actually know what the going rate is for a photo for this type of usage in the real world is.      Are the photographers that took these photos profiting from these sales? Or  did they sign over rights when they submitted their sets so tough luck?   Not sure who's the pot or who's the kettle in this one. You're literally stealing from the poor to make yourself rich while Prince is stealing from the rich to make himself rich.   Edit: for people saying ""but they choose to  then don't take the job"". I'm guessing you find it ok that they are getting paid far less than minimum wage and that 3-6$ a photo isn't insulting. Because someone chooses to take a job  is it just OK to pay them 3$ an hour? Yeah  no. Especially when the going rate for full ownership of a photo like this is exponentially higher.   Why do people do it? Oh  for the same reason that 43 yr old single mom was ringing your order up at McDees today.    I respect Prince stealing more. It's less insulting  to me.         **EDIT EDIT: You still didn't answer if you think that paying photographers less than $5 a photo (which is exponentially lower than the industry standard) for FULL copyright is fair.** ",IAmA,5297,31433011081,hammelman,Technically we all are.

While I love Hearthstone  I've been feeling this way for a long time. In the beginning  it was easy to explain away concerns because the dev team was reportedly small. Now that the game has become so popular  and presumably a big money-maker for Blizzard  you'd think they'd invest more into improving it.  As you said  the core of the game is great. The strategy  atmosphere  Graphical/sound touches... all things that keep me coming back.

Don't connect your self worth to a dating profile.   Edit: Look  Tinder is basically a replacement for the tried and true activity of meeting people at a bar. It is not a hookup app because women are not that slutty (at least they don't want to be perceived as such).  If you're trying to get a woman to meet you for sex from within the Tinder app  you're an idiot and should just delete the app and resign yourself to a life of vicarious creepery.   Women look at profiles. So do men who aren't creepy desperate losers. Not everyone has trouble finding sex partners. Actually most people don't. That's why there are profiles and not just naked pictures. People are looking for people they're interested in dating.   It is a dating app. Not a hook up app  though it can be used for that. But you do not want to catch something from a Tinder girl who is easy.   Your profile can be improved immensely by good photos of you being social  doing cool things  and generally being the type of guy the girl is interested in. For most women  that's everything that happens off your computer. Though there are plenty of nerdy girls on there.   The text of your profile should convey wit  charm  confidence  and masculinity without trying too hard. It's worthwhile to try out a few different profile texts and to rewrite it a few times plus ask a friend's opinion. Female opinions especially if you are neck beard status.   I've successfully used Tinder to ""hookup"" and dated a girl who I did love at the time. My current girlfriend I met at a bar. It's virtually the same experience.

In Australia  my state has the 2nd worst e-cig laws  but itäó»s not as bad as Queensland.  Though there isnäó»t much in the way of reports of it being enforced  but these are the restrictions already in place.   -	**Australia-wide liquids containing nicotine are illegal to sell.**   Here in Western Australia electronic cigarettes are classed as a äóìDevice used to mimic smoking.äóù  -	The sale of the physical e-cig devices is illegal. This is regardless of if it looks like a cigarette or if it is sold with or without juice already in it. You can import them from another state/country. (this means cigalites  egos  box mods  Iäó»m sure you can still buy wire/cotton to DYI coils as it would be impossible to enforce such nonsense).  -	The same applies for the nicotine juice in WA  though you cannot sell it in Australia  you can import it legally.   -	Technically as this was pile on top of existing legislature  using them in public areas is illegal. Nothing specific has been addressed (likely due to the rarity of the devices here).  In Queensland electronic cigaretts are classed as a äóìTobacco Productäóù  -	**Nicotine juice is illegal for personal use. All done and dusted.**  -	But good-o  the sale and supply of the physical devices is legal. (because you know how convincing a device that contains no nicotine is to someone that would potentially use it to reduce harm or completely quit smoking with). Sooo youäó»re puffing away at fairy juice are ya? Also  if you do sell them  youäó»re not allowed to have a publically visible display and certainly cannot advertise.  -	Use in any already existing non-smoking area (all indoor and outdoor public businesses  all public transport services and every inch of land they own  in your own car if you have kids which is a good call for smoking). THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE FOR NICOTINE-FREE ECIGS SPECIFICALLY AS NICOTINE JUICE IS ENTIRELY ILLEGAL.   So in Queensland CIGARETTES are legal  but NICOTINE JUICE is illegal.

You are NOT limited to just these keywords listed below. So you can add ""Gorgons CP Giveaway"" or ""Xyor the Unwed""  or anything else. Just replace the activity keyword to what you are manually specifying.  Having the tags from the charts below added to your title makes it a lot easier to understand what you are doing.

For the body you can leave instructions on whether you want them to add you  or you will be adding them  and any requirements you may have. If you want to add anything else to the title  you can  just keep it short.

Take it or leave it  it is up to you.  Firstly  I wouldn't really say ""I helped"" anyone. It's the information that is out there that I just shared with the people. And frankly  my post was kinda spontaneous  because I don't have anything to do with marketing/PR side of the game. But I am a helpful guy so if somebody feels they have been helped  then yay.  Being perfectly honest  we have a sort of a running joke around the office that we could give away preload/retail preload copies on the street (in Warsaw we have had this place called ""Stadion""/""Stadium""  which in the 90's and early 00's was a defunct sports stadium where you could openly buy pirated games)  because it is useless without the patch that will be released on the launch date. The binary file is what matters.  And the problem with pirates is that you will never ever stop them. It's like arguing with the internet - can't be done  can't be won  can't be ""handled"". I laugh wholeheartedly when some big company manages to aggravate the internet  the results are always hilarious and the backfire is almost always spectacular. So the decision of the people who are in charge of CD Projekt (meaning my bosses) is not only a smart one  but a very bold one.   Why bold? Because development of DRMs is the easy way out in the corporate environment. It is easy to go to your shareholders and say ""we will release this product and we will spend X amount of money to make sure we inconvenience the pirates"". People who do not know much about the gaming world will consider this the only logical move - because in the corporate environment  you are taught and expected to shape reality through money and influence.   It takes a lot of guts to produce an AAA game on a multi-million dollar budget and say ""it will have absolutely no copyright control software"". Because you are going against the money-making logic  where you need to control the way the clients get access to your product. Everybody does this now  apart from a small handful of companies.  The problem is  in the end  DRMs only hurt the people who paid for their games. They will experience technical difficulties. Their game will stop working altogether. And since refunds aren't common  and support can't always help  they will be left alone - their money taken  nothing gained in return.  For a pirate  everything is added value  since he/she gets it for free. A broken poorly cracked game will still provide entertainment since it takes no effort to download it. If some features (like online) are left out  they will just play the way they can. And since DRM will be removed thanks to the endless competition of the scene groups  they won't deal with technical problems that stem from it.  So hey  buy the game. Or not. It is your conscience. After all it's a game of statistics: there will always be a fringe group of people who don't buy games. But if you try to fight them  you don't really fight them  but the paying customers.  And if we need an even more logical argument  I have heard of a study done in Poland  where it was established that every person has a fixed budget that he/she will spend on entertainment in a given amount of time. If they exceed this budget  they will not spend any more money. And if at that point they didn't buy the game  they won't. This is anecdotal though  I have never tried looking for solid evidence on the myth of a ""lost sale"".

Ants tunnel farther into the soil than what it may appear. It is common  depending on the species of ant  for them to be tunneling at least a foot into the ground.  The penetration of rain into the soil depends on a variety of complex factors  such as how much rain was received  the soil type and how dry the soil is. The ants can tolerate the rain passing through their nest. Fortunately for them  it is unlikely to pool below the soil surface because water generally moves through the soil until it reaches the groundwater. However  if a site is kept excessively moist  the ants likely would die and the colony would not survive.

Unfriend your exfriend  and leave a message stating exactly why you are doing it  and then go no contact. Remember that their decision has been made  be firm with yours.  Don't answer the phone when they call.  They decided they didn't want you around.  Don't let them weasel out of it later.  Go no-contact. If they don't want you and your family around that is there prerogative.   You have to decide who you want in your life.  Do you really want someone who is this shallow.  I understand the desire for a no stress vacation.  But  they can choose to take a different vacation instead of just uninviting you from it.  There are lots and lots of better ways they could have handled it.  They deliberated between themselves and decided that this was the course of action they wanted to take.  Well that's fine  but this course has consequences.  Primary among them being they just shit all over you and your family.  You should remember this when they want to be friends later.  **They don't want your child around them.**  Do you really want to be 'friends' with them after this?  Expect them to act like you are being unreasonable.  They will act like its no big deal. It fucking well is a big deal.  They just told you exactly who and what you are to them.  Remember that!   You may want to come up with some preplanned comments for when you are confronted by them in the future.

In case she finds this post I would just like to say:  Boo fucking hoo.  You're fat as fuck.  Not just overweight.  You are fucking lard obsessed.  Looking at that jiggly flesh abortion you call a body is repulsive to anyone with a functioning sense of sight.  Sorry  but none of us made that rule  easy as it is blaming us for the fact that there is no MySpace angle great enough to hide the effects that years of ""rewarding"" and ""comforting"" yourself with processed food and sugar every time you so much as changed that stretched out airship canvas you call a ""shirt"" has had on your body.  Hell  even you agree with me.  Pull up a picture of some gigantic fat man with rolls spilling everywhere.  Now pull up a shirtless Chris Hemsworth.  Which one is getting your thick  greasy juices flowing?  But it's totally different when it's *you*  right?  We just need to get to know your personality!   You're fun and quirky and sweet and being fat doesn't define you!  Right.  It's almost like we've heard it all before  from a million fatties.  Each absolutely convinced that they're special and different.  The only crime anyone here at FPH has committed is being honest with you fucking greasebeasts. The fact that you would rather attempt to force us to accept you as attractive through censorship and browbeating rather than simply following the few simple steps it takes to actually be attractive shows an embarrassing level of self-absorption and can only lead anyone not looking to hammer another nail into your hugbox to conclude that you're just as fucking repulsive on the inside as you are on the out.  You could change right now.  You could take an honest look at yourself in the mirror and realize that within a few months you could actually be those things you delude yourself into thinking you are.  You could have a moment of clarity and finally understand that the way you live your life is disgusting to literally everyone  and anyone telling you otherwise is lying to you to either preserve your feelings or to drag you back into the same shitty hole that they themselves can't escape from.  You could download a calorie tracker app and ask for fitness tips from the endless number of Internet sources and start *right fucking now*.  But you won't.  You'll keep telling yourself you're ""curvy"" and ""voluptuous"".  You'll keep convincing yourself that it's fine to have that third cheeseburger since you ""must have walked like five miles today"" and ""probably burned about 4000 calories"".  The delusion that you can't get matches on Tinder because you don't have any good pictures and everyone that rejects you is just a shallow asshole will be your daily comfort as you casually swipe past men or women that weigh less than you  yet are still not attractive to you because of their weight.   You'll keep trying to silence the only people that aren't lying to keep you miserable  and when everyone has been forcibly quieted and your precious feelings are sufficiently protected  your ultimate reward will be that you get to be fucking fat and disgusting forever.

Basically  like a week ago I started using a sensitivity toggle between my default ""3.10"" and extremely high ""400"". I've seen someone else do that in one of the Matchmaking games at the beginning of rounds and I thought it looked silly and didn't think much about it. I never killed anyone while doing this and more to the fact  you can't even move while doing it! This could mean that people SKIP through while reviewing cases.""*  He says: ""like a week ago I started"" but that was edited in  before he said he had been doing it for months. Edited the post to make his pretending to cheat look less than in the original message.  He also had a message bound to the same button used to toggle to extremely high sensitivity  a message suggestion he cheats. Sadly I do not remember the exact message nor can I find it again as he has deleted that from his post.  He had also received a minorly disruptive ban a little before  which was probably due to him pretending to cheat (under the griefing rule). Yet he continued to pretend to cheat after it. So possibly the majorly disruptive ban isn't because of being suspected of cheating but rather under the griefing rule.  ---  So same thing as I said 3 weeks ago on his steam profile:  ""My guess is that you purposely pretended to be a cheater  including the message you added  to demoralise the opponents. And when people start to purposely pretend to be cheaters it makes banning cheaters harder + you cause overwatch to waste time... So yeah getting banned for cheating may be unjust but I absolutely think you deserved a ban.  It's quite simple: action = reaction. If you'd have more respect for others this wouldn't have happened. Everybody who purposely hurts efforts against real cheaters in my opinion deserves punishment too.  You can't even take the punishment as a man. You cry about it everywhere. You're an egoistic  selfcentered ass. I am too but I don't pretend to cheat and I certainly don't do anything that could hurt attempts at banning real cheaters...""  ---  Regarding ""MajorlyDisruptiveGuy's"" message: I'm not lying at all. I have nothing to gain/lose by this. 3 weeks ago I had read every single thing he had said about this. Here: ""I honestly don't know why I got banned"". Steam: blame toggle sensitivity thing and keeps hardcore blaming it for over 2 weeks (as you can see in the link on top of my post). Then here ""I honestly don't know why I got banned"". Steam: ""I agree that I should be banned for griefing"". Now: ""I'm a nice guy to play with  the demos are there  see for yourself."" And as he quotes my ""victory dance"" comment  would be kinda odd if you'd be the only one getting banned for doing something like that  isn't it? &amp; He got banned for griefing before. You edited out your original comment on the majorly disruptive screenshot on your profile which is clearly visible because of the ""Royale with Cheese says: '' "". Sadly I don't have screeny of the original message. It's quite clear he's hiding things and purposely not telling things.  Further about his statements concerning griefing: http://imgur.com/a/BRZC4 Going from badguy to victim. Considering the first 2 messages I'm probably not the only one who doesn't believe it all later when he tries to downplay it  as if he only TA cheaters.

As a bee keeper that would LOVE to get a free hive of bees that are acclimatized to the local area  I will gladly collect a swarm free of charge.  I also don't charge if the hives are easily accessible.  I will  however  have to charge for any sort of removal that requires a ""cut-out"" (or cutting away of material to reach the bees) just due to the danger involved.  There's also a contract to sign that says that any damage done to the property is the responsibility of the owner to get repaired.  (Having done small scale construction  I do at least know enough to do the least amount of damage humanly possible).    There's other reasons not to spray the bees  other than the obvious fact that it kills perfectly friendly and important honey bees:  You ever smelled a bunch of rotting brood in the summer?  Imagine that scent going into your house every year.  Not to mention that you may be able to kill off the hive  but after that poison eventually dissipates  other bees will find the hive and rob it.  So for at least a short time  you'll end up with more bees flying around  and you won't know if they're moving in to set up shop  or just stealing the honey.  Then there's the fact that an established comb is an attractive target for more bees (or wax moths  cockroaches  etc.) to move in and set up shop.  Presuming you seal the hole up well enough  you still have to contend with the scads of ants that will eventually find the old honey/brood.    There's plenty of reasons to simply have the comb professionally removed.  Even cut-outs tend to be very cheap in the scheme of things.    But PLEASE let me make ONE suggestion.  Before you call a bee keeper to remove the hive/swarm  *get a picture of one of them*.  Even a blurry picture is easy enough to identify for anyone experienced with the critters.    [This is a yellow jacket.](http://www.pesticide.org/Alternatives/phase-2-solutions-for-consumers/YellowJacket.jpg)  Not a honey bee.  These are highly aggressive  and can sting multiple times (until their venom runs out).  This is the single most common call I get.  Their nests are made of paper  and can range from ""[normal and small](http://img.thrfun.com/img/018/855/yellow_jackets_nest_s.jpg)"" to ""[sweet holy Jesus burn the whole town to the ground.](http://www.pestid.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/YellowJacketNestInCarInterior.jpg)"".  They will build nests *anywhere*.  Inside trees  hanging from trees  in bushes  in garages  in the ground  doesn't matter.  Worse still  they are carnivorous  and I've even witnessed them *eating my bees*.  I can't describe how much I hate these things.  They are an [invasive species](http://cisr.ucr.edu/german_yellowjacket.html)  and I would recommend anyone that sees them stock up on RAID and do your part to help these bastards go extinct.  Worse still  an estimated 1 in 1000 are deathly allergic to their venom (compared to anywhere from 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 50 000 allergies to honey bees.)    The [Honey Bee](http://www.atlanticpestsolutions.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/honey-bee-md.jpg) is furrier  cuter  and friendlier.  They can only sting one time before dying  and they know it.  Typically  they will ""ping"" you (bounce off of you) as a warning if you get too close (seriously close  like within 3-6 feet) to their hive.  The vast majority of people that get stung each year are stung for reasons that have nothing to do with aggression on the part of the honey bee:     1.) The bee got tangled in hair  and people panic and start swatting instead of letting it untie itself and fly away.    2.) The bee landed on someone (they'll drink sweat) and they panicked  and smashed it  getting stung.   3.) The bee was just checking you out because you looked interesting (they like bright colors) and you panicked  and swatted it  causing it to land on someone else  or inside of your own clothing.   4.) The person stepped on them bare-footed.    I don't have statistics  but I'd personally estimate that (if you take domestic bee hives out of the equation) that would probably account for 99.99% of honey bee stings each year.  Even ""Africanized"" honey bees (which are far less frightening than the media makes them out to be) don't go out and hunt people down.  They only respond (with lethal force) to people disturbing their hives.    So rambling aside  honey bees are generally friendly  wasps are not.  Honey bees you can seldom  if ever  see the nests  wasps you can ([mud daubers](http://pestcemetery.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-42.png) are another common nuisance wasp  but not nearly as aggressive as the yellow jacket).    Then there's [carpenter bees](http://natural-japan.net/photos/Xylocopa_appendiculata04.jpg).  These idiots are the ""Scrappy Doo"" of bees.  The females have stingers  but they tend to be docile  and hide out in their holes.  The males  on the other hand  are *very aggressive* and will fly around in your face all scary-like  despite the fact that they don't have stingers at all  and the best they can do is bump into you angrily.  While they're harmless to people  [the damage they'll do to your house](http://www.pestid.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/LarvaeInGalleries.jpg) makes it important to exterminate them on site.    But all of this said  bee keepers will *only remove honey bees*.  We are not exterminators.  But we're usually glad to come out and pick up a free hive (they cost us close to $200 a pop to get a hive shipped to us) and in a perfect world  we'll find a [swarm](https://planbeeproject.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bees-swarm-bicycle.jpg) that hasn't established itself yet.  (Swarms are lazy  gentle  and not at all interested in stinging anyone.  They are far more interested in finding a new home than in attacking anyone  as they're full of honey they loaded up on for the trip.  They look scary  but they're the *least* dangerous thing you'll find.)

For most of his United career he was the best freekick taker in the world  he's still pretty good and one of the best.   It's just advancements in ball technology reducing the ability to control a knuckleball combined with him having to adapt his biomechanics due to his patella tendinosis mean both his technique and explosivity have been compromised.   Since he moved to Real MAdrid he's still one of the top 10 if not top 5 in the world for goals scored from freekicks. Sure  he might take a lot but he also gets asked to take shots from absurd distances and angles by his managers so naturally his accuracy is going to be lower than other top FK takers.   People seem to have this messed up idea that he's some sort of dictator that does what he wants and fearsome  respected managers like SAF  Mourinho  Ancelotti etc. haven't had the balls or political power to tell him to stop taking freekicks from distance.   Constant long shooting via freekicks and in open play is a strategy to keep GKs on edge  tire them mentally. It's not easy for a defence to concentrate like that all match long - concentration is the single most draining part of a GK's game. All these top managers use Ronaldo's long range threat and ability to genuinely threaten from distance to break teams down mentally.

If you read the article  when they talked to various people on the hill  they found these rules are the exception  not the norm. The vast majority of representatives find a way to get by without them.   And really  this is downright stupid. There's nothing stopping a male from making a false claim of sexual harassment against a male politician. In fact  considering the shear number of closet case politicians  such a claim could be just as widely believed as a female claiming sexual harassment.  It seems to me that these handful of politicians are just using lawsuits as an excuse. They don't take women seriously; they think of them as secretaries  not serious advisors. They exclude them from higher-level discussions  and then they just blame it on a vague fear of lawsuits.  ,news,-186,01432060916,tahlyn,So no one has to read the article  the four charities:  * The Cancer Fund of America   * Cancer Support Services   * Childrenäó»s Cancer Fund of America and  * The Breast Cancer Society   &gt; All were created and controlled by the same network of people and led by James Reynolds Sr.  the F.T.C. says.

[This alone is not a fireable offense.] I saw a message she wrote  saying to please not show up.   [Edit: [The message](http://www.standard.co.uk/incoming/article10203755.ece/alternates/w620/crop.jpg) &gt;Hey i made as many of you hosts so please invite loads of BME Women and non-binary people!!  &gt;Also if you've been invited and you're a man and/or white PLEASE DON'T COME just cos i invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only. Don't worry lads we will give you and allies things to do. ;)   She requested  using words like please"" for white  cis-gendered males to go. Nothing about this was a 'public forum ' or a  ""we need to get everyone here"" thing. It sounds to me much more like a private meeting to try to work certain ideas out. And it also alludes to other events that will be hosted that *all* will be invited to.]  Look  the ""Kill all whitemen"" tweet is inexcusiable. And I think she was tactless at times  but there are lots of reasons to keep things down to one gender or group for that type of meeting. First  it makes oppressed minorities feel more comfortable to be with their in group. Second  confident and white males can often dominate a conversation  one that's not even for or about them. I've seen both things often at many universities.  The other thing that's not being talked about is protections of academic freedom and organization. Most universities will stand by their staff and faculty. They  nowadays  have PR reps and lawyers ready to handle conflicts.  [Point being: There would need to be many aggravating factors  not just one incident. And for something like ""moral turpitude"" to be established  the behavior and actual harms would have to be high. But even so  it just depends on the university and the power of the person acting.]  **Edit 1**:  I'm not sure I understand the downvotes. I was just explaining the university's most likely rationale.  **Edit 2**: Nowhere does the above message say she shouldn't be fired. It leaves that topic alone.  Also  I would challenge anyone to provide a reason why anything I said was racist. If anything  it is descriptive in its treatment of what happens in these meetings. And if downvotes show the inability of someone to explain themselves when faced with opposition  reaction to this post shows exactly the behavior I talked about.  **Edit 3**: It's quite clear that any moderate opinion is going to get blasted. In which case  go ahead and give me my downvote. I'm at -223 and counting. This post just sadly proves that no one can openly talk about race and racism. The feelings are too strong  and the reason too sparse.  But here are a few things to help you out:  *Racism as an Individual Phenomenon*: These are aggressions that are targeted against one person as a member of a race. Think shouting racial slurs or bashing.  *Racism as an Institutional Phenomenon*: This is the one that most governmental agencies and academic research groups are most concerned with. Here  the agent of the racism is most often a system or a representative of a system. It doesn't really matter the race of the person enacting it. What is most important is that certain racial groups are systematically discriminated against. E.g. In America  conviction rates for black and brown convicts are much higher than for white convicts  even when looking at similar crimes.  *Historical Context  Probability  and Power*: Why is anti-white racism not the same as anti-black? Well  in America  slaves were first sold in the 1600s. Slaves could be owned until the late 1800s. Lynching and public violence were live and well into the 1960s. And today  police brutality negatively affects inner city minorities. It's **a credible threat** whenever ideological anti-black racism is voiced. People live it day in and day out. It's not a credible threat whenever someone loses their composure and threatens ""white men."" Now  I'm not justifying it. It's immoral  unjust  and not tactful. I'm just saying  it's much different. It'd be like a little kid threatening a grown man that he will beat him up. The threat from a little kid is not nearly as meaningful as one from a grown man  a grown man who has a history of beating the little kid.  *Problematizing Race*: In the scholarly literature  it's not at all clear what a ""race"" is in the strict sense. In fact  it's most probably some sort of culturally constructed identity. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist  or that you can't find the pattern. It just means that  when scrutinized  it's hard to tell what's founding the racial identity. Why does this matter? Well  it shows how superficially stupid racism is. In addition to harming people  it's actually based on a confused concept.  **Caveat**: I'm American. I'm using examples from America. But I realize this story is from the UK.  **Edit 4**: Feels pretty bad to be unincluded or treated differently  doesn't it? Now imagine that this was how governments have treated you for 400+ years.
