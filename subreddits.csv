We_‹_d like to make it clear that while it is devastating to have lost our beloved pet  and this tragedy was obviously completely avoidable  an excessive use of force  and a dangerously negligent act on the behalf of the Officer - we would have found satisfaction in an apology  and for the Wyckoff Police to have told the truth surrounding the circumstances that caused this disaster. Unfortunately  the Wyckoff Police have defended the actions of the officer  assumed no responsibility  conducted no official investigation  and have consistently contradicted the reports of the two eye-witness neighbors  as well as the physical evidence at the scene. Very clearly  they are not being truthful  nor accepting liability for an extreme act of negligence.   **WHAT THE POLICE SAY**  Though the Wyckoff Police Department has not yet released the official police report  we spoke to the police chief on the afternoon of 05/01/2015  and asked if he was sticking to the details that he made public through the media. He confidently confirmed that the details of the police report would be consistent with the statements he made to the media on 04/30/2015.   We are told that while dispatch issued a call to 621 Lawlins Rd.  the officer verbally confirmed the incorrect address  stating _‹_622_‹ù over the radio. He was not corrected. The police maintain that the officer then proceeded down the driveway to the front door of 622 Lawlins Rd.  the Vukobratovic residence. He then supposedly knocked loudly  multiple times - finding no one home  he entered the back yard through the unlocked gate  and proceeded into the yard  around the landscaping  to a the patio area where he discovered an open window. According to the police  the officer considered the window a possible point of entry for what he believed to be a burglary in progress  and drew his weapon. It was at this time that Otto  _‹_lunged_‹ù at the officer through the open window  attacking his boot. The officer maintains that the dog _‹_had him_‹ù by the boot  and considered his life to be in danger  which was reason for him to fire four rounds at the dog - two of which missed  the other two hit Otto in his back and side.  After the incident  Animal Control arrived to take Otto to the hospital. No investigation was made on the actual crime scene. The officers who arrived on the scene scoured the yard looking for the casings and bullets from the missed shots. No report was made regarding these ballistics  nor were any photographs taken of the scene. The Wyckoff Police department maintains that the use of force was completely justified  as the dog was violently attacking the Officer  putting his life at risk. Despite this  the officer sustained no injuries. The officer remains in active duty.  **WHAT WITNESSES SAY**  Two adult residents and a child were home mid-afternoon on 04/29/2015. Having just had their windows professionally cleaned  the blinds in their home were open on every window. One of the residents was inspecting the work done on the windows and noticed some unusual damage to one of them  indicating a potential point of entry for what could be a future burglary incident. He called his cleaning service  and they denied causing the damage. Not wanting to create an emergency situation  especially with a child in the home  the resident drove to the Wyckoff Police Department to file an official report regarding the damage. He spoke to an officer at the front desk  and was told a patrolman would be dispatched to his home within the hour.  A short time later  a patrol car pulled onto the street in front of 622 Lawlins Rd.  and both residents of 621 Lawlins Rd. approached the front of the house - one at the window  one at the door. They observed the officer exit the vehicle and proceed down the driveway of 622 Lawlins Rd. There were no cars parked in the driveway of 622 Lawlins Rd.  so the residents of 621 had an unobscured vantage point. Moments later  the officer was observed entering the backyard through the gate. Within seconds  one resident observed Otto coming around the corner of the house  barking at the officer. The officer was then observed taking a _‹_standard shooting position_‹ù and firing multiple times at the dog. The resident observed dirt being kicked into the air from at least one of the shots being fired into the ground. Upon hearing gunshots  one resident left the house  yelling at the officer for being at the wrong address  questioning what he was doing. He raised his hands to his head as a gesture of disbelief regarding his own actions.  **EVIDENCE**  The officer claims he entered the property  came around the side of the house  and observed an open window that he believed was a possible point of entry in relation to this _‹_burglary_‹ù call. While inspecting the window  Otto lunged from the window  startling the officer  at which point he fired four times at the dog. This is easily disproven. The eyewitness statements are extremely clear about being able to observe the officer firing at the dog near the gate  nowhere near any open window he could have been alerted to.   On Thursday  04/30/2015 Zana Vukobratovic discovered a bullet casing laying in plain sight on the grass near the gate to their backyard. Officers were called to investigate the casing  but made no photograph of its location  handled it without gloves  and did not thoroughly document the scene.   On Friday  05/01/2015  while walking in the yard  Igor and Chris (his friend)  discovered a bullet embedded in the dirt  approximately 18 feet from the entrance to the backyard. The location of this bullet is supported by the statement of the resident at 621 Lawlins Rd. that saw dirt kicked into the air from one of the shots. Realizing that there could very easily be additional evidence still at the scene  Igor and Chris combed the area  and discovered a bullet casing resting in the leaves  mere inches from the casing recovered on Thursday 04/30/2015.  The photo below demonstrates the likely position of the officer at the time of the shooting based on the location of these three pieces of ballistics:  http://i.imgur.com/iYVJOl9.jpg  As you can see from the below photograph  while standing in this position  the officer would have not had a view of the rear patio area where the open window was supposedly observed:  http://i.imgur.com/xre81Zv.jpg  Here you can see how close the bullet in the dirt was found in relation to the entrance to the backyard. The officer very obviously opened fire within the first few feet of the backyard:  http://i.imgur.com/BKgHuB5.jpg  Below is the undisturbed bullet casing No. 2 that was found on Friday morning  05/01/2015:  http://i.imgur.com/blcnBxa.jpg  **MOVING FORWARD**  At the time of issuing this statement  we have not alerted the Wyckoff Police Department to the discovery of Casing No. 2  or the stray bullet. Quite frankly  we are concerned with their integrity  being that police chief does not seem interested in an official investigation. We have sought legal counsel in regards to charges that may be brought against the Wyckoff Police Department  and have determined that we will be pursuing them for damages  which in accordance to New Jersey law  is limited to the cost of Otto himself  and expenses related to this tragedy. Despite their extreme negligence  excessive use of force  discharging of a firearm in a residential neighborhood  and fabricated police report  the officer will only be held accountable by the department itself. If there is enough support from the community  we may be able to drive the point home that we do not tolerate this kind of irresponsibility on our local police force - nor do we tolerate the fabrication of details in order to protect a wildly negligent officer responsible for needlessly murdering a family pet in its own backyard. It is up to us to hold them accountable.  --------  **Support:**  - Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Justiceforotto  - [Petition (has some typos  Igor didn't make this)](https://www.change.org/p/wyckoff-nj-police-department-fire-officer-kyle-ferreria-for-the-murder-of-otto-the-dog?recruiter=11862285&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=autopublish&amp;utm_term=mob-xs-share_petition-reason_msg&amp;fb_ref=Default) ,conspiracy,2673,01430752185,AgainWithRestarting,Do they have the boot that the dog allegedly bit?,conspiracy,975,01430753593,valtastic,"They haven't responded to any of the accounts  haven't returned phone calls  and have deactivated most relevant email accounts  FB comments  etc.   Edit: They actually just deleted their FB page too.

Anyone feel free to repost this content anywhere you find appropriate:  Governments literally create false realities to keep people in conflict. That is so that populations remain fearful of each other and divided and do not unite to overthrow the elites. It is a part of a strategy of tension that has been employed for at least hundreds of years through governments and probably thousands of years through relgions.  It is not natural for people to hate each other like this. We are manipulated into it. The following is a passage from Howard Zinn's ""A People's History...""  &gt;  Black and white worked together  fraternized together. The very fact that laws had to be passed after a while to forbid such relations indicates the strength of that tendency. In 1661 a law was passed in Virginia that ""in case any English servant shall run away in company of any Negroes"" he would have to give special service for extra years to the master of the runaway Negro. In 1691  Virginia provided for the banishment of any ""white man or woman being free who shall intermarry with a negro  mulatoo  or Indian man or woman bond or free.""  from another section:  &gt;  Bacon's Rebellion brought together groups from the lower classes. White frontiersmen started the uprising because they were angry about the way the colony was being run. Then white servants and black slaves joined the rebelï_ lion. They were angry  too-mostly about the huge gap between rich and poor in Virginia.  &gt;  The greatest fear of wealthy southern planters was that black slaves and poor whites would combine in another uprising like Bacon's Rebellion. One tool to keep blacks and whites from uniting was racism. Edmund Morgan   a historian of slavery in Virginia   wrote in his American Slavery  American Freedom that racism was not a ""natural"" feeling about the differï_ences between black and white. Instead  white leaders encouraged a negative view of blacks. If poor whites felt contempt for African Americans  they were less likely to join with them in rebellion.  It's the same strategy gone global. And now that we have instant global communication  they can't just lie about it in the newspaper and trick everyone. They have to actually act it out or find patsies to act it out for them.  Think about it... do you actually have reason to hate anyone? ....or have you only been taught who you should hate? Do you actually know for certain that the individuals in every ""terrorist act"" are actually who we are told they are? Would the people have actually had the motivation or resources to commit an act of terror or were they only able to do it because a government agency enabled it?  These are all legitimate questions.  http://www.sott.net/article/125878-The-Strategy-of-Tension-NATOs-Secret-War-Against-Europe  &gt; Daniele Ganser  professor of contemporary history at Basel University (Switzerland) and chairman or the ASPO - Switzerland  published a landmark book about ""NATO's Secret Armies."" According to him  during the last 50 years the United States have organized bombings in Western Europe that they have falsely attributed to the left and the extreme left with the purpose of discrediting them in the eyes of their voters. This strategy is still present today  inspiring fear for the Islam and justifying wars on oil.  Tufts Professor  Michael Glennon  even explains this in his book ""National Security and Double Government"". The TL;DR is basically that you don't have any choice or right to self-determination anymore because anything can be justified in the name of ""national security"". http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Glennon-Final.pdf  &gt;  National security policy in the United States has remained largely constant from the Bush Administration to the Obama Administration. This continuity can be explained by the _‹_double government_‹ù theory of 19th-century scholar of the English Constitution Walter Bagehot. As applied to the United States  Bagehot_‹_s theory suggests that U.S. national security policy is defined by the network of executive officials who manage the departments and agencies responsible for protecting U.S. national security and who  responding to structural incentives embedded in the U.S. political system  operate largely removed from public view and from constitutional constraints. The public believes that the constitutionally-established institutions control national security policy  but that view is mistaken. Judicial review is negligible; congressional oversight is dysfunctional; and presidential control is nominal.  So you saw that video off the Charlie Hebdo thing  right? Here is what I saw. I'm no expert  but I have been putting in a lot of time into reading and learning how these operations work:  I saw a couple of professionals work smoothly and cleanly. They had a very well-planned out attack and made a nice escape. It certainly did not look like a couple of guys who have never seen action and suddenly self-radicalized. Even if you have trained  unless you have seen a lot of action and can control yourself  then you are going to be panicked and scattered. Those guys were smooth and in control.  Not only that  but the big tip-off to me was the leaving behind of the ID cards. This always conveniently happens. Oswald's wallet  James Earl Ray's ""bundle of evidence""  and even the passports that miraculously showed up at 9/11. It's a common tactic because it works so well on the general population and spin control through their agents in the media can discredit those who point out the absurdity.  Now what happened the next day?  Well  a couple of guys took some hostages in a bakery or something. This is where those agents who try to find people willing to become radicals come in. If you had to make something like this happen  what do you do? You probably show them that you can get them money and weapons. You probably use your knowledge of other fake acts by other agents to show them that you are connected to the terrorists. Then you tell them  ""The signal is coming. There will be an attack today  then muslims like us everywhere across Europe will stage a coordinated attack. Your mission will be to hold hostages in this bakery!"" Then they see the attack happen and believe that it is real. These aren't ever really bright people to begin with so they never figure out they are being set up. The reality is those poor patsies would have probably never had a vector to do anything at all if these agencies had never enabled them. Do you think they got those guns by themselves?  Seriously... this is how those types of things operate. You have to create an illusion like a magician. If you go and look at those JTRIG slides  that's exactly what they talk about. These guys love to compare themselves to magicians that create false realities. Examples here: https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/ and here: https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/  I know it sounds like madness  but we have some really famous quotes to back it up:  &gt;  William Casey  CIA Director 1981-1987: _‹_We_‹_ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false._‹ù  &gt; The aide said that guys like me were ""in what we call the reality-based community "" which he defined as people who ""believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality."" ... ""That's not the way the world really works anymore "" he continued. ""We're an empire now  and when we act  we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality_‹Ójudiciously  as you will_‹Ówe'll act again  creating other new realities  which you can study too  and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors ... and you  all of you  will be left to just study what we do."" _‹ÓUnnamed White House aide[1] The quote is now widely attributed to Karl Rove  This is what Karl Rove meant by ""we are history's actor's"". They are literally creating a reality of their own choosing (that of course serves themselves) for the masses to move them to the actions that they want them to.  edit:  Made a TIL post about this today.

OK  so after all that confusing explanation  this is MatPat's proposed timeline:  1. Fredbear's Family Diner Opens 2. Phone Guy kills first child  possesses the Puppet 3. Freddy Fazbear's Pizza 1st location opens- new animatronics Golden Freddy  Golden Bonnie  Bonnie  Chica  and Foxy are introduced. 4. Phone Guy develops killing pattern-using Golden Bonnie suit to lure children to backroom to their death. Kills 5 more victims. 5. Two employees die due to springlock malfunctions in Golden Freddy and Golden Bonnie suits  creating the ghostly Shadow Bonnie and Shadow Freddy. 6. Phone guy pre-records phone calls explaining how to use the springlock suits  both employee deaths incidents  and the missing children incident (FNAF 3 phonecalls). 7. The Puppet  in an attempt to give the children new life  stuff the children's bodies into Freddy  Bonnie  Chica  Foxy  and Golden Freddy suits (FNAF 2 cutscenes from perspective of Freddy animatronic; FNAF 2 GIVE LIFE minigame) 8. 1st Freddy Fazbear's shuts down due to various incidents &amp; foul odors coming off animatronics--saferoom that stores the Springtrap animatronics is permanently sealed off. 9. Grand-reopening of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza at a brand new location. 10. Phone guy kills 5 more victims using a Golden suit  prompting the Puppet to take action and attempt to have the Freddy animatronic to try and kill him (SAVE THEM minigame  FNAF2) 11. Phone guy recordings of FNAF 2 (up until Night 6 call) are pre-recorded during the summertime. 12. An investigation during the summertime occurs looking into the 5 missing children  DOES NOT SHUT DOWN new restaurant.  13. FNAF 2 begins--New Employee Jeremy Fitzgerald takes over night shift in November.  14. Phone guy MAKES PHONE CALL to Jeremy Fitzgerald (not pre-recorded!) on Night 6  explaining someone moved golden suit  that all animatronics are malfuctioning  and that there's a party they have to throw tomorrow. 15. After Night 6  Jeremy is moved to dayshift; new employee Fritz Smith takes over nightshift. 16. During the party  Mangle bites Jeremy Fitzgerald's frontal lobe (Bite of 87); Fritz Smith is fired  for the company believes he's the one who tampered with the animatronics (including Mangle). 17. The Bite of 87 causes the second location to shut down. The older animatronics  which are now deemed safer than the tampered-with newer animatronics  are sent to another location in the hopes of the restaurant one day returning. 18. Restaurant RE-OPENS AT 1ST FREDDY FAZBEAR'S PIZZA location.  19. Phone guy  who now works nightshifts  pre-records all messages for new employees. 20. Shadow Bonnie and Shadow Freddy  having died at this previous restaurant  lead the now-possessed Freddy  Bonnie  Chica  and Foxy to boarded-up saferoom  in an attempt to have Phone Guy dismantle them  releasing their spirits (FNAF 3 in-between night cutscenes). 21. Phone Guy records Night 4 phone recording while running from released spirits of the children. Hides in the Golden Bonnie suit  fails to recognize the wetness of the rained-out room  and dies in the suit as the springlocks malfunction. His spirit possesses it  but no one finds Phone Guy for years due to the room being boarded up. ((FNAF 3 in-between night cutscenes). 22. Because the Phone Guy technically is still around  the children STILL possess each animatronic in hopes to permanently finish the job. (FNAF 3 BAD ENDING) 22. FNAF 1 begins--Mike Schmidt is hired to the nightshift and listens to Phone Guy's pre-recorded messages for instructions. Is caught in the cross-fire of possessed animatronics. 23. Mike Schmidt is fired once it gets noticed that the animatronics are once again malfunctioning (he's blamed for it). Freddy Fazbear's once again shuts down. 24. FNAF 3 BEGINS- Fazbear's Fright opens 25. Phone dude finds Phone Guy's prerecorded messages for springlock suits AND Phoneguy in Golden Bonnie suit (SPRINGTRAP) 26. The puppet returns to the exhibit to finally finish the job. 27. The animatronics spirits are finally at peace and leave the suits once A. All hidden minigames are completed and B. Fazbear's Fright burns to the ground (due to the Puppet)  presumably destroying the Springtrap suit and Phone Guy with it (FNAF3 GOOD ENDING).,fivenightsatfreddys,154,01430998847,rubyeye456,The last two games were rushed because Scott was working with Universal  that's why they didn't look their best.

I totally get how busy some of you are  I hardly have time to sit down for an hour this time of year  and I know you guys have it just as bad or worse  so maybe this is a thing to think about more when summer starts and thinks (hopefully) mellow out for everyone.  When I first joined here  [these](http://i.gyazo.com/ad6992d581812ed5e05c6a4621e51d1e.png) were the mods (also the CSS was icky  props to cryo and raia) and the interacted with the community ALL the time  just on the wayback page there are 2 mod posts (albeit one a daily thread) and another trading post from darkcollector. Keich and Grumpy talked to us a lot  my experience with darkcollector was great  A11 and NotSince posted a lot more then  Cryo was always kind of reclusive I guess  Porygon-bot still sucked. Basically the mod-user interaction happened a lot more than it does now. Going through a few mods history (I know this discounts IRC  but most noobs don't use that Q_Q) I really don't see a lot more than ""don't trade this here."" etc. which is good! that kind of stuff is really important! But I definitely feel like a lot of the camaraderie that used to be here is gone. People don't really use the IRC as much (we've been having dead hour at fucking 8pm est now  wtf)  and overall the friendly atmosphere we had that distinguished us seems to be lacking.  Again  I totally get how busy people are  I'm not try to say everyone should be on the IRC 24/7  or on the DDT hanging out all day  you guys are all really swamped with real life things on top of mod things and i get that. But i feel like interacting with new (and old!) users is as important  or at least nearly as important  as doing flair apps or policing the sub  and there are some mods here that if I didn't look at the mod page I wouldn't even know they existed.   Some of you guys have real life things that are waaaaay more important than the stuff you do here  and I'm not trying to single anyone out at all. This is all just my opinion  and the opinion of the few people I've discussed it with. I think Joels words were ""It's become more of a job"" for the mods  and I think it would be more fun and more enjoyable for both sides if all this rambling shit I wrote was thought over at least a little.

You can all take this how you please. Lets talk about event farming.  It comes down to a something fairly simple we all learned while in grade school: Supply and Demand.  * First let me begin with stuff like Coro Coro Garchomp  PCBCs  PC Scizor/Gengar and Coro Coro Charizard. These events were distrubted in early XY. You had to actually order the Coro Coro magazine in order to get the code for Charizard and Garchomp. Fast Foward to right now. How often do you see Coro Charizards for trade? or better yet  a Coro Garchomp? You don't  because there are very few that exist around this place because **they were not mass farmed**. These hold a very high value. Lets say you have a PC Froakie. Thats a 1 day event in Japan. That should be pretty rare wouldn't you think? Well not really. The time PC Froakie was given out is the time (Japanese) event farming really became a problem. Now lets compare the Froakie to the Coro Coro Garchomp. You were able to get the code for Garchomp for a month or two and the period to redeem the code was also a few months long. So why is this 1 day event less value then what seems to be a fairly easy to obtain code event? There are ~7 total Coro Garchomps on the sub while there are a good 20+ PC Froakie on the sub. I can snap my fingers and have a PC Froakie in front of me in a matter of minutes  depending on what I'm offering of course but for me to find a Coro Garchomp will be much more challanging.   * Now lets see GameStop Diancie. Everyone was so happy that finally NA got an event. Some people couldn't really contain themselves. At the beginning the value of a Diancie Code was about 2-3 shinies  as time went on the value dropped and dropped and dropped. Why? Because instead of taking one or two codes and putting them up for trade  they instead advertised they had 100 codes (I'm not making this up  somebody really did have 100+ Diancie) Fast forward about a month into the distubution of Diancie. You look on the front page and all you see are threads with ""FT: Diancie Codes"".  The value has dropped from a solid 2-3 shinies to 1 shiny. Fast foward a little more  there are EVEN MORE Diancie codes! People are literally giving them away because they don't have the time to redeem themselves. The value of a single Diancie code dropped down to about 1 5IV Breedable. The supply heavily outweighed the demand.  * Hoarding: Some people don't condone this  but it can work into your advantage quite well. The perfect example of this is the Worlds Aegislash. A lot of people are aware that a large group of users from the sub all went to Worlds together with the main goal of farming this event. There are easily 50 Aegislash on this sub that have never seen a trade thread. So why does Aegislash hold such a high value still? There are so many of them! Because the people who farmed/obtained these events did not go on the sub the next day trying to trade them for anything and everything they could get their hands on. Another great example are Walmart Garchomp/Scizor. This event was given by code when you bought a copy of X or Y from Walmart in North America.  North America! There will be tons of these. Wrong! In early XY when these events were active shinies were like gold. You would see a Walmart Garchomp being traded for a mere 2-5 shinies. Something that would never happen today. Fast Foward to now. How often do you see Walmart Garchomp/Scizor for trade? Not very often. The people who grabbed these for super cheap way back in the day held on to them and waited for the DEMAND to rise.  * Now lets look at some events which *should* be rare and valuable  but really arent. Facebook Charizards is the prime example. 2000 codes in total given out  thats a really small number for the whole world right!? A handful of users made duplicate FaceBook accounts in order to get more codes. I know of one person who got 10+ codes just by themselves. So while there are only 2000 codes in the world  but lets say 400 ended up on the sub the challange for you to obtain one becomes very small. Singapore Gengar is another good example. There were 3000 codes total given out IN SINGAPORE (You actually had to be at the venue in Sinagpore to receive code paper) Myself and lots of other users thought this would be out of reach for most of us. On the day of the event 1 code showed up  people went nuts! Then another  then another  then one person had 2 codes  then 3  then 4. You get where I'm going with this. Something that was suppose to be exclusive turned into something mediocore (Mostly cause the NA Gengar was going on at the time  and the only difference was OT/ID so really only hardcore event collectors would care about that)  * /r/pokemonexchange has a very very very big effect on our event values. The amount of people selling on Exchange has tripled even in just the last month or two. I had mentioned earlier in this post that when PC Froakie/Piplup and such were active is when event farming became a real problem. I know of multiple people who got 2-3 sets themselves. Now I'm not going to tell you to not buy  I'm not going to tell you to not sell. I do it myself. Just be aware of what you are doing when asking/farming these events. PC Froakie/Piplup were 1 day each. It theory these should be worth quite a bit. 1 day  In Life  Japanese. In this case there was a very large demand but the supply still outweighed it. Same goes with Coro Rayquaza codes. Sure they are free  and the period that they hand them out is fairly long but when somebody gets 10 codes just for them alone then try to trade them all at once  you're flooding the market. If you go pick up 10 WHF Rayquazas and post a thread looking to trade them all. Same concept. ""Why are my 30 Coro Rayquaza codes worth nothing?""  * In conclusion. The main reason for this post is for the upcomming VGC Pachirisus. I know you're all excited to get your hands on something other then a Wifi Event and even expand your own collection by trading these things. Just remember one thing: Supply and Demand. The more people that farm. the less demand there will be  in turn making the value lower and lower and lower. You're not only screwing yourself out of something good but also screwing your fellow traders. If you want to make the most out of this event/experience don't go and post a thread on exchange offering reservations  don't take 8 of them and put them all for trade at once. Trade your precious rodents for something you want  don't just settle.  Thats all folks. Happy trading!",pokemontrades,16,01430929235,Rodnazics,Oh darn.

Both of these will make the job of the security services much harder.   What this will do is make peaceful non conformists  like myself  look over our shoulders to a far greater degree. As far as I am concerned :-  - I am a pacifist anyway but  even if I were not  I don't think the offensive action by our troops is doing anything to protect our country (quite the opposite).   - I refuse to give to military charities and I refuse to buy or wear a red poppy.   - I also do not support the military propaganda of parades through our streets.   - I don't believe in hereditary privilege so I am a republican. I don't wish the Royals any harm but their position is society is an anachronism in modern society. Most of the tourism is generated by the buildings and these would remain (hopefully run by the national trust).  - I don't demonstrate or seek confrontation but I am perfectly aware that I don't espouse the 'British Values' that Theresa May talks about.   - Essentially  I don't expect other people to necessarily agree with me but I value my right to free speech to be one of the awkward squad.

I work in the sector (for government  so moderately independent) in radiation protection so I get to see the good and bad side of nuclear.  The good is that it generates huge amounts of energy quite cheaply (when averaged out across power produced in its lifetime ""Levelised cost"" or ""LCOE"")  [far cheaper than most fossil fuels and some renewables](http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm). This includes all aspects of building  running  refueling and decommissioning. [It also contributes quite highly to the economy](http://www.nei.org/Master-Document-Folder/Backgrounders/Fact-Sheets/Nuclear-Power-Plants-Contribute-Significantly-to-S) providing job boosts in the surrounding areas. It's rather [safe too](http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/safety-of-nuclear-power-reactors/) as technology and design has improved it to the point where [minimal human interaction is needed in the event of necessary shutdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_nuclear_safety)  which is incredibly useful as most historic accidents have occurred due to human error. Regarding the design of nuclear plants (including safety)  a principle called [ALARP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection#ALARP) is applied to ensure that exposure and risk of failure is kept *as low as reasonably ~~possible~~ practicable*. These highly scrutinised criteria to ensure that the chance of an accident  and impact on public safety  are immeasurably low.  The bad  of course  is that waste can be a problem but [reprocessing](http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Fuel-Recycling/Processing-of-Used-Nuclear-Fuel/) can minimise the amount of actual waste produced  and create fuel sources for other reactor types. We also have the issue of nuclear accidents  but with safety features used in newer reactors  the chance of this happening is astronomically low. At least I hope so because I'd likely be one of the first responders in the event of an emergency! Another ""con"" that is often mentioned is the dwindling source of uranium  but this is a common misconception. Whilst it is true that there is probably only a few hundred years worth of uranium ore left in current mines  the [Japanese were experimenting with extracting naturally occurring uranium from seawater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_mining#Recovery_from_seawater). This would give Earth *billions* of years worth of uranium reserves at current usage rates  and I think the Americans recently made a breakthrough with making this process more efficient.  Overall it is an energy source with pros and cons  but what source doesn't? The pros outweigh the cons significantly in my opinion  with plants being remarkably safe now. It's carbon neutral  has potentially vast amounts of fuel sources  and provides massive amounts of energy for comparatively few sites in comparison to renewable and fossil. Personally I think the world should press on with nuclear to make it a key part of the grid in the next few years or decades  and supplement it with renewables (wind  tidal  solar  hydro  geo)  whilst pumping further funding into renewable technology and nuclear fusion for them to ideally take over grid supply in the longer term.  Sorry if this comment is a bit fragmented  I've written it very quickly during some downtime at work and I've missed out quite a bit. I'm happy to try and answer any questions that anyone might have and expand on things if you're interested  but bear in mind that I'm a relative newbie in the field (15 months) and I am specialised more in the safety and protection of nuclear sites  and accident response to an extent.

The downvote button is important. The problem with this subreddit isn't the existence of a downvote button. I realize it's just a ""trial"" but the entire idea is pointless to begin with.  The beauty of MMOs is that they appeal to gamers of many different unique tastes and preferences. Players can get satisfaction from different things.   * Some players play to collect gear/mounts/minions/titles/achievements  etc... * Some players play to simply become their in-game persona and escape from reality for a little bit. * Some players play to take on the hardest content  and love the intellectual challenge of raiding and min-maxing to push themselves to the limits.  These are just a few common examples from an infinite list of reasons to play FFXIV.  The **REAL** problem with the people on this subreddit (and MMO communities general) is **a lack of respect for players who play this game for different reasons than their own**. People will upvote content that appeals to THEIR specific tastes and they will downvote content that doesn't.   Casual players don't give a shit about hardcores min-maxing their Turn 13 strategy and don't want to see this kind of discussion taking over the subreddit. Meanwhile  hardcore players don't give a shit about commissioned artwork of your scantily clad Miqote.   As a result  content appealing to the smaller demographics get buried  even though it's a very thought-provoking and insightful discussion. Less popular demographics get neglected.  **It has become an ""us vs them"" mentality.** People see players of other demographics as an enemy who threatens THEIR enjoyment of the game  instead of friends who share a common interest. That is the REAL problem. It can't be fixed by tweaking subreddit configurations.  Taking away downvotes doesn't change anything. Popular content rises to the top. Unpopular content sinks to the bottom. Nothing changes except now people can't downvote the TRULY shitty threads like ""Plz tell me y I should buy this game lol"" that truly pollute this subreddit.  Besides  if you really want to downvote someone  you can just click their username and downvote stuff from there. Not very difficult to circumvent.  Leave the downvote alone. The ability to upvote/downvote is what makes Reddit unique and awesome. It allows people to express approval/disapproval. You're attempting to take away people's freedom to express disapproval in an attempt to serve the greater good. You don't have to read very far into your history books to realize why this is a dumb idea. If you want to take the downvote button away from all of us just to silence a few trolls  the trolls have already won.  TL;DR:  * Removing downvotes solves absolutely nothing. It only makes it slightly more inconvenient to downvote things. * Downvoting is important. It allows us to help filter incorrect information  stuff that doesn't contribute to the discussion  and overall useless fluff. * The root of the problem is that players of different demographics don't respect each other. This is a community-wide problem. Removing downvotes does not remove negativity.

These people who are stuck are dumb and should just quit!*  You can't talk about how awesome you are and then talk bad about the general player base in the same point. If you're such an exceptional player  then something like SoF **should** be easy for you. You are not the definition of the average player if you're making comments about how exceptional you are. I think it's safe to assume that SE tracks how players perform on content they release. They wouldn't nerf it if they felt the community as a whole wasn't clearing the content at the rate they were expecting.  *SE is money hungry and just wants people to pre-order Heavensward!*  No shit.

Titan either could have forfeited the last round (and the rest of the game) or forfeited overtime. Saying it isn't a forfeit is just dumb. It would have been much better to acknowledge that it was a forfeit  but turn to rule 22 instead.  At the same time  it was 1v5 and Titan acknowledged that.

Its not their style  blizzard will spend months inhouse tinkering and messing and thinking then they will release a big patch.   IMO its having a negative affect on SC aswell  from playing LOL ive come to appreciate the benefit bi monthly or monthly patches can bring to a competitive game especially one like LOL and HOTS where the meta and game benefit from constant tweaking and growth. But thats not in blizzards nature from my experience i feel they rely too much on big patches developed in house  that sometimes when released are redundant or actually bad because they are always playing catchup to the evolution of the game. In the past its lead to game stagnation  op and broken units going on seesaws from op to nerfed to pointlessness and in game metas reacting accordingly.

However  I find it hard to be grateful to the USSR  and especially to Russia as the successor of the USSR for this victory. Russians like to conveniently set the starting date of the war as June 22  1941 and to portray the conflict with Germany as a defensive war  what they call the *Great Patriotic War.* In reality  however the USSR started in on the action almost at the same time as Germany  when it was still a co-conspirator with Germany in the aggression towards Europe.  My home country of Moldova  or more exactly the region of Bessarabia  was one of the earliest victims of Russian aggression  alongside Finland  Poland  and the Baltic states. After Moldova was forcibly annexed to the USSR  its population was subjected to a brutal wave of repression. My own grandparents in fact came close to being deported to Siberia  although they benefited from an early warning and had a chance to hide during the wave of deportations. They were the lucky ones  many others in my extended family were not. The same personal story is true for millions across Eastern Europe from the families of the officers who were shot at [Katyn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre) to the purging of a large swatch of the intelligentsia of Estonia  Lithuania  and Poland.   Moreover  it's not as though the end of the war inaugurated the onset of peace and prosperity in the region either. No  what followed was yet more misery as the Soviets trapped us behind the Iron Curtain for an additional four decades. In light of these events  it's impossible for me to see the USSR as anything but yet another criminal regime that directly caused the suffering of millions alongside the Nazis. In the clash of the two totalitarian states  Nazi Germany and the Communist Soviet Union  there could be no winning for the states and peoples trapped in-between  just more or less suffering.

(PID)**  **How is it currently?** PID is illegal in Switzerland.  **What would change?**  PID would become legal in one select case: If a couple tries for artificial fertilization  they can screen the implants for genetic diseases. All other PID remains illegal -&gt; no selection for sex  no creation of rescue babies (grow stem-cell donors for siblings).  **Who proposed it?** The federal council.  **What does the parliament say?** The majority supports this amendment. There are two minority arguments against it:    * Principally opposed to PID (long term effects for society  effects for disabled people).  * To make the creation of rescue babies legal as well  **Who opposes the amendment?** Nobody major.  **Will it pass?** Probably.  **2. Scholarship initiative**  **How is it currently?** Scholarships are available through university and cantons. What you get and how much you get depends on where you live.  **What would change?** Harmonise the scholarships. The federal government would determine who would get how  much and then the cantons would pay it. And the scholarships would be increased on average to better support students.  **Who proposed it?** student organisations  **What does the parliament say?** It opposes the initiative  but agrees that the current situation is not satisfying. For this reason the parliament has proposed an alternative solution: They created a law which will sanction cantons (by withholding federal subsidies for scholar ships in that canton)  if they do not uphold the rules laid out in an earlier agreement made by the cantons among each other. This would set the minimal scholarships to 16k. This concordat is currently non-binding. The law will only come into effect if the proposal is rejected.   **Who opposes the amendment?** Government (too much centralization  unnecessary with current situation  additional costs)  **Will it pass?** Probably not.  **3.  Million-Inheritance tax to support welfare state**  **How is it currently?** Currently there is no federal inheritance tax.  **What would change?** A federal inheritance tax would be implemented. Anyone could deduct 2 million from the tax  anything beyond that is taxes 20%. The income of this tax would be used by 2/3 to bolster the social retirement fund (AHV) and 1/3 would be awarded to the cantons. This tax would replace all cantonal inheritance taxes.  **Who proposed it?** Four political parties: SP (socialist democrats)  EVP (evangelical party)  GP (green socialist)  SGB (Swiss Trade Union Association (one of several)).  **Who opposes the amendment?** All the other parties.  **What does the parliament say?** They oppose it  since they believe the cantonal   **Arguments for:** fair and useful  small and medium inheritances are better protected  the parliament has enough wiggle room to protect family businesses  better AHV.  **Arguments against:** More centralization  harder for family business inheritance  not enough to save AHV  no difference in tax for closer relatives  the new law would be applied retro-actively until 2012  weaken Switzerland's stand in the international competition.   **Will it pass?** Probably not. Initiatives from the left opposed by the economy almost never pass.  **4.  Reform for national TV/Radio**  **How is it currently?** If you own a TV/Radio you have to pay a fee. This fee is collected by Billag  one of the most disliked/hated companies in Switzerland. The fee is 462 CHF annually.  **What would change?** The fee would be replaced by an universal  but lower fee. Every house-hold would have to pay 400 CHF a year. Additionally corporations with a yearly revenue of 500'000 and more would have to pay a fee as well.  **Who proposed it?** This is a law that was created by the federal council and passed by both parliaments. Now a group of people has gathered 50'000 signatures for a referendum against the law.  **Who opposes the law?** A bunch of people (mostly centre liberal business types)  **What does the parliament say?** Is in support since the current situation is bad and outdated.   **Arguments for:** Current system is outdated and with a lot of administrative cost. New system is simpler: Everyone pays. Lower fee. Nobody watches national TV illegally anymore.  **Arguments against:** Corporations pay double. The public service is not accurately defined the fee goes towards funding bullshit TV. No longer a fee but a tax. The federal council can adjust the number without having to change the law.  **Will it pass?** Probably.

Step by step this is how the business plan would look like:  Research phase:  1. First of all go to local hardware shops in your area - slightly higher quality ones and also if possible try and speak to builders / real estate construction guys to see if there's a market for these more premium door handles in your city.  2. Try to get a feel for what some of these ""premium"" brass door handles look like and how they are different from the Rs. 200 - 500 bracket regular door handles or aldrops. You will develop an eye for this over time as you browse competitor websites and supplier images etc. For eg www.victorylocks.com http://www.dorsetindia.com/ - For suppliers go to www.alibaba.com and type ""brass door handles"" or ""pull handles""  3. Learn about the different categories of these door handles which are mainly: Pull Handles (used in offices / restaurants on glass doors usually)  Mortice Handles (used in homes and the biggest seller)  Handle on Rose (horizontal handles)  Handle on Plate (vertical handles)  Main Door Handle (larger designer pull handles used in premium / rich class homes for their main door)  Once you have done this research and feel comfortable knowing the product type and can tell what is a ""premium"" door handle and what is a regular one  you will have a good idea of what kind of handles to source from your supplier. To make things simple just try and copy the inventory of this guy: www.decolocks.com  Business Set Up phase  1. Decide a brand name  logo and all that jazz. ""Diamond Locks"" or whatever you like. Set up a cheap website for now just to make the brand appear legit and established.  2. Get this business registered as a private limited company - nobody will take you seriously if you go to clients offices accepting payments in your personal savings account. ;) There are sites that offer this whole pvt. ltd registration service at like Rs 5 000 to Rs 10 000 - get it done.  3. You should already have an idea of a few good suppliers from Alibaba.com but now is the time when you really need to lock on one supplier and finalize a ""sample order"". Here's one that I use: laotongjiang.en.alibaba.com / http://laotongjiang.en.alibaba.com/productgrouplist-222097622/Brass_Door_Handles.html  4. Finalize your first import order from China - this is more like a ""sample"" order to get your business started. Choose like 10 to 20 different door handle designs you want to  sell initially and order 10 sets of each. This is going to be the biggest start up expense and this first sample order will cost you around 2 lacs more or less.  5. Google for a ""freight forwarder"" or similar company in India. Here's one I use: http://www.seatransmovers.com/ These guys take all the hassle out of importing and will take care of all the paper work etc and import the door handles safely for you from China.   - Just a word of advice: Importing from China is a bit of a skill in itself  negotiation etc matters a bit and you will learn this along the way.   My friend's dad barely knows any English but he is a damn good negotiator and knows Chinese people like the back of his hand by now. Remember  as the buyer YOU are in power and these Chinese exporters will be eager to please you as long as you appear like a ""big"" guy to them. Promise big orders in the future etc.  - Once the first lot of door handles from China arrives  get your product catalog printed and also product packaging with your own branding printed. This is more important than you think. You want to really invest in a very premium looking product catalog / brochure because this is what your clients will see in meetings for the first time. Also your product packaging must look good.  The catalog has pictures of all of your door handles that you just imported from China and things like a company profile page etc all presented as beautifully as possible. The catalog should feel like you are a million dollar company manufacturing brass door handles in a big facility somewhere in your town.  The whole premise of this business is appearing like a legit manufacturer of premium brass door handles and not letting clients know the fact you import them from China. This is not cheating or anything  its just how white label brands operate. Karbonn Mobile etc all are basically doing the same thing in a different industry.  - Once your catalog  business card etc is ready - its time to step into the battle field. Either you personally or you and some friends act as salespersons for your own firm  visit hardware shops  hardware dealers / distributors / wholesalers - offer them sample pieces  give them your catalog - meet with them - tell them you manufacture premium brass door handles for high end apartments  buildings  offices  hospitals etc.  This is the most crucial step of this entire operation and I could write an essay on this step alone but you get the idea... you have to go out there and do the sales.. build customers  give them free sample pieces if you have to.  This product does sell fast - once you build customers you will just grow naturally from there.  So to sum it up:  1. Research your local door handle market 2. Set up business legally as a pvt ltd firm  get logo  catalog and shit done 3. Import first set of door handles from Chinese supplier. 4. Repackage these door handles into your own branded boxes. 5. Go out there and meet with builders  real estate guys  construction guys  hardware shops  hardware distributors etc - in short the SALES part.",india,185,11431490228,rcha,Not sure why Many Indians are not aware of it. 1971 war is almost led to WW3  .people should reading more these kind of wars where geopolitics and true colors of some nations is on display . ,india,189,01431500811,RajaRajaC,Ok and?

Both cost money. There is a common argument against renting that somehow renting is ""throwing money away"" and that paying a mortgage is all about building up equity.   First  a mortgage payment is heavily skewed to the interest portion in the beginning part of your mortgage. So if you get a 30 year mortgage and plan to move in a few years  there will be little to no build up of equity through mortgage payments. And with most Americans moving every 6-8 years  there is a high chance that you will not have the time to build up that equity. Then there is also the fact that all of the other costs associated with owning a house - property taxes  insurance  repairs  normal maintenance  emergency fixes  etc - is not going to build up equity and is also being ""thrown away"" in the sense of no capital buildup. Even things like needing new appliances are not going to raise the value of your house much  because a normal home buyer expects there to be working appliances and would simply discount your house if there were none.   However  it still may be cheaper to buy a place and set aside enough money each month to pay for the extra costs of repairs  maintenance  property taxes  etc than it is to rent. The opposite may also be true. You can check out the [NY Times Buy Vs Rent tool](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) and play with the factors including property prices  rent prices  length of time in home  interest rates  downpayment  etc. It will take into account opportunity costs - the ability to have used the money you would put towards the house to other investment opportunities. This is often where the calculus tips towards renting.  Another reason we often advise people who come here to rent is because of other financial stress. If you don't have a proper emergency fund  you are setting yourself up for financial stress and failure. There is no more landlord to fix the main pipe that burst so you need to be prepared to deal with that. If you don't even have a downpayment  where you will be able to get the money to replace the roof? Obviously not through a HELOC and if you can't save before buying a house  it is likely you won't be able to save after buying a house.  There are other reasons as well  including the need for mobility and expected upcoming life changes. Tying yourself down at a time when you need the flexibility to up and move for that amazing career opportunity is self-sabotage.  The short version is that it may be financially imprudent to buy a house because of the rent versus buy calculations  capital requirements  or lifestyle choices.  Now onto the car argument. If you buy a used car or if you lease a new car you are getting the same good  namely transportation. That is where the comparison with housing stops. Because after 3 years with a lease  you turn it in and get another  larger payment for a new lease (inflation and all). Rinse and repeat forever. Now with a used car  once you pay it off  it is yours. Since you can pay off a used car in a usually short amount of time and the car should still have many years of life  you drive around sans car payment for quite a while  which you will never do while leasing. A used car has gone through the largest depreciation period already and will hold its value much better.   With a lease - always have a car payment. With a used car - get to car payment free rather quickly.  Now  if we are talking about new cars  the numbers change. Some people will always want a new car. If your plan is to buy a new car every three years or so  then lease.

I never heard of it before but it does make sense.   *Someone care to explain how I'm wrong? ,personalfinance,-61,01431693990,AcquaPiovana,"I hope I don't get buried.  Former bank employee  current financial worker  and former homeless  street rat here.  I hope I can help.  1) You need ID.  Do you have a current photo ID?  If not  please get one.  Have a secondary form of ID  too  if possible.  Birth certificate  SSN card  anything govt issued.  2) If you're unsure how much debt is taxes or city/government-based  I would advise *against* putting this check in a bank under your identity.  The account could get frozen in as few as two business days  and you will probably never see that money again.  3) It is difficult (near impossible) to cash a check of that amount if you're not a current account holder at any bank  even with proper ID.  You can definitely try to cash it at the bank it's drawn on  but make sure you have ID up the wazoo  and a small branch may ask you to come back another day if they don't have the reserves to give out that much at one time.  Also  you then have the issue of where the F to put this money.  This might sound crazy  but if you do successfully get this money in cash  you might want an old fashioned suitcase-type thing with a combo lock.  I think Staples sells stuff like this.  4) I would advise that you then flip the money into a cashier's check made out to yourself  but this gets messy too  as many banks have fraud policies in place that state they only draft bank checks for customers.  As previously stated  you probably don't (and shouldn't) have a bank account in your name at this time.  5) Do you have someone in your life you trust  infinitely?  You mention signing it over to someone else.  This is potentially the best option  as long as the person helping you is the most trustworthy person known to man.  You are  almost literally  trusting them with your life.    What you would do is: accompany this friend/family member to *their* bank (not the bank the check is drawn on).  Walk up to a teller together.  Present ID.  State that you are endorsing the check over to the other person  and he/she is depositing it in their bank account.  The fact that you're *there* will alleviate any red flags for the teller  who is almost definitely not going to find any of this sketchy or throw up alarm bells.  It would be different if you *weren't* there  and this account holder showed up trying to deposit a $20k check in someone else's name which was simply double endorsed.  That could result in extended holds  and research.  Then  wait for the funds to be verified by the bank and the money to become available.  (Side note: I hope this friend of yours banks at a big bank like B of A  because this will make things easier for you down the road... *edit for clarity* if you're leaving town  I mean... having checks for a small three-location bank will be almost just as useless as your huge check  if you leave the area).  THEN I would go back to the bank and have this friend request a series of bank checks in your name  then give you a certain amount in cash (a couple thousand?).  The bank checks keep your money safe while giving you control.  If lost  they can be replaced (keep the carbon receipts!!!).  They can't be cashed by anyone else.  You may also want to drop some money onto a pre-paid master card  which visually resembles and operates like a debit card.  You *DON'T* need to supply visa/mastercard/amex with your SSN in order to maintain one of these types of cards.  Be warned: this type of money-movement will result in paying fees.  There will be fees to get the checks in the first place  fees to cash them later if you're not an account holder  and fees to maintain one of those silly pre-paid cards.  But these are your limitations in going off the grid.  6) As someone else said  I would get the F out of NYC  as your money will last longer elsewhere.  Like  almost anywhere else you go.  Pre-paid rent (though ill-advised by someone else) might be required since you don't have proof of a job or references  probably.  But see if you can pre-pay for as little as possible.  Three months?  Five months?  7) Be frugal with anything you buy  because this amount of money can seem like a lot  but will go fast.  Buy used stuff  get a small apartment  eat at cheap places  conservative cell phone plan  etc.    8) While still keeping your working money (the $20k) off the grid  once you're established somewhere  begin contacting lenders and saying you are ready and willing to make some arrangements  but you still have no job.  Make sure you have a mailing address and email account to keep in contact with them to keep your promises.    9) Enjoy the job search.  Waiting tables might be good?  Data entry?  Again  I would consider something outside of NYC (possibly out of NY entirely  to get as much lag-time on city-based debt as possible).    Most of all: good luck.  *edit:* I didn't expect so many kind words towards me  of all people.  Thanks reddit  you're cool today.  I want to add one more thing:  I didn't strongly address the addiction or mention rehab for a few reasons.  But overall  I'm giving OP the benefit of the doubt because the post suggests a conscientious move towards changing his/her life and taking control.  I agree that getting a fist full of cash as an addict is not the best idea  and my post is not meant to advocate that.  I wanted to give realistic solutions to put this money in the hands of the person it belongs to to improve his/her life  because I know what it's like to be at the bottom and feel like  even when good stuff happens to you  you get roadblocked at every turn.  Therefore  if /u/cantcountnoaccount has the correct info about a Bellevue detox and 28 day rehab having no up-front cost  then **DO IT**.  Checks don't typically go stale (""expire"" for lack of a better word) in a month  but OP should definitely check any clause on the check that states ""valid for ____ days"" or the like.  Some checks have clauses as few as 90 days.  If the check does not explicitly state that it goes stale in a set amount of time  the general rule is 1 year for a ""corporate"" or company check  and 6 months for a personal check.

Or you can go to the probate court and see if they have volunteer attorneys who handle these matters. 1. it is true that you are not liable for any debts of your mother.  Your mother's estate will be liable for her debts.  Do not sign any paperwork that has anything regarding your financial liability.  Do not agree to undertake any of the costs of your mother's treatment.   2.  Get yourself to a social security office and apply for benefits if your sister is still a minor. 3. Essentially the debts for your mother's hospital stay will be wiped in the estate.  It's too late to apply for COBRA benefits as someone else suggested.  See if the hospital has a financial ombudsman  but don't sign any paperwork unless you have an attorney review it first.   3.Credit card companies  and many utilities have debt forgiveness programs  but unless you are a co-signor on any of your Mother's debts they can only collect against the assets of the Estate anyway. Also  these programs are run by particular departments/individuals within each organization  so the average customer service representative is just wasting your time.    4. If you don't have access to funds to hire an attorney  you can try to probate the estate yourself.  There is a learning curve  but its not impossible  or for that matter particularly difficult.  The difficulty lies in not understanding the terminology and the process  not some secret law tricks only lawyers have access to.  There are many law books and help from webpages you can research.   5. Many districts have statutory fees that a lawyer can receive for probating an estate.  You should find out what fees are normal in your area before you agree to be represented. 6.  If you and your sister are living in your mother's home you want to prioritize payment of the mortgage and utilities.  It is very hard to get out from under foreclosure proceedings  and much more costly in the long run to let those bills fall to the estate's responsibility and have to dig your way out  than it is to maintain the status quo  if possible.  Also paying the household bills is arguably a ""loan"" to the estate  which also makes you a creditor to the estate.  Therefore  keep meticulous records of any expenses you do pay.   7.Never pay the credit card debts  they are unsecured  and sit at the bottom of the debts paid out by the probate court.  Ignore all the hospital bills (they'll be coming several months after the hospital stay)  except as a debt of the Estate.   8.  In my state  debts of the estate are paid as follows: Funeral Bill  Attorney's fees  Fiduciary fees (the executor gets paid for his work)  Taxes  Secured creditors  unsecured creditors  heirs  9. It is possible you will be forced to sell the house to settle the estate if there is not enough cash/assets to pay the debts.  Don't let that freak you out at the moment.  In my state the court has a nine month window from the opening of an estate to the closing  and that window can be extended many times.   If you are in the situation where the house is at risk of being sold in order to settle the estate  and you and your sister are staying at the house  then worry the more about maintaining your own good credit than paying the mortgage.   10. Call the pension administrator.  There may be terms under the pension for this situation that will allow it to transfer to you or your sister.  There may be a death payout that would help you over the hump. 11.  When dealing with any institution do not leave them an original death certificate unless they require it.  Always ask them to keep a copy of your certificate instead.  Get at least 3 but no more than 5 copies of the certified death certificate when you first get them.  Usually the funeral home will ask you how many copies you want.  Later  if you need more copies you will go to the appropriate agency to get them (city hall  probate court  it differs from place to place)  9edit commas for clarity  additional advice)  Sorry for your loss  I hope some of my information helps you out.",personalfinance,3250,31432758215,strugglingcomic,Very  very sorry for your loss. I offer you my condolences  but since you are here  I think you are more interested in practical advice.  1) Try to stay as calm as you can. Since you are in charge of finances  you should be aware of any and all outstanding debts and obligations  as well as assets. Being able to evaluate your situation calmly and logically will be invaluable to you and your children. Do not make any rash decisions now (i.e. don't try to sell your house immediately or something like that).  2) Your top and immediate focus is on the basic necessities. You need a roof over your heads  food on the table  and to handle funeral expenses  that sort of thing. Do not worry about making investments or even reporting income for taxes just yet. You still have many months to work out those details later. Whatever money you have coming to you in the next few weeks  park it in your savings accounts and don't touch it for anything other than absolute necessities. Pay your rent or mortgage on time  pay your utilities  get the groceries  and pay off or minimize your high interest debts.   3) Make sure you have a support network for you and your children  relatives or close friends who you trust absolutely and who you can delegate some tasks to. Don't be afraid to reach out for help  including professional help such as a grief counselor or therapist for you and your children. Your mental and emotional well being is just as important (if not more so) as your financial well-being.  4) A few months down the road  sit down and plan out more of your financial future. Either hire an accountant or do some research about how you plan to use the money available to you  and what your tax obligations look like. But you do not have to worry about this right now  you seem to be in decent shape financially and should be fine to put your finances into a holding pattern for the next few months. But keep in mind  you will need to find stable full-time employment by then as well  once you feel ready for it.   I know my words must seem tiny and insignificant compared to what you're facing right now. But please understand that you are not helpless  you can do this  and you can take care of your family going forward. It won't be easy  and of course it won't be the same  but it is far from hopeless or insurmountable. Take it all at your own pace: one breath  one step  one day at a time.,personalfinance,2635,41432833473,HerpDeeps,"File a police report.

Almost a century ago  students at A&amp;M started standing up for the entire game ... not because they couldn't see  or it was a particularly interesting part of the game  but because the students were showing the coach and the team that they were all ready to go down  suit up and play on the team if needed.

The ""oh  we stay at each other's places pretty much every night!"" is NOT the same. You still have your own place as sanctuary to run off to if need be. When you move in together you don't have that any more. You learn so much about someone when you have no choice but to interact with them every single day. You learn that he hates when you leave your makeup piled up on the counter  you hate that he floods that bathroom when he takes a shower. Rather than accepting it as  ""well  it's their place""  it forces you to have open communication about the things that bother you. You really have to work as a team and learn how to make life easier on one another. Some people are great at making that transition  while others find that they're simply incompatible with their partners. I personally think it's necessary.

I went to The Salty Suite before Bam 7  in Melbourne  Australia the thursday before the tourney. Mango  Chillin  Leffen  S2J  Lucky  Alex19  Hugs Wife  and all the Australian Smashers. The Place is in a cool bar looking place.Everyone was having fun  people were drinking( I dont drink) and people played smash. There was this girl from the area I met there and she was hanging out with Me and and some others. Afterwards  we went to another Bar called ""Abc"" just to chill  SD  Skeletom  and about 10-12 others were with us also. Mango Hugs  and some others met up with us a little later. The Girl that was with us was drinking some Tequila drinks. (She had 4 in total) She wanted more drinks but I said you should probably stop and she did. We then were all walking around the CBD in Australia(The City of Melbourne) looking for more places to go to. We finally found some place and by this time it was about 1-2am in the morning. I think their was about 12-15 of us give or take in the place. We were at that place for about 30 minutes or so until it closed. The trains at this time were closed and I asked Reef(the Australian Smasher I was with) if he could give her a ride to her car. She parked it at a train station about 10-15 minutes away. Reef being cool said yes and he drove her. In the Car it was Reef  driving  Nathan  in the passenger seat  and the Girl and I in the back seat. Both of our seat belts were on but we were holding hands and kinda cuddled up. We finally get to her car about 10-15 minutes and we part ways. the Girl and I planned to meet up at the Pm tourney they were having the next day. The next day came and I entered Pm doubles and Singles( I took leffen's spot since he didnt show up) The girl never showed up but messaged me and said she was going to come later to watch the top 8.  Top 8 was at a different venue  it was at the Bam 7 venue. So I finally get there and play some melee friendlies with Australian's best and even play Spud from New Zealand( That guy is amazing) The Girl finally shows up and I asked her  how she was and if she remembered everything from last night since she was Intoxicated a bit. She sad bits and pieces I said ok and she said she doesnt want to get drunk like that again. After that  interaction I sat down to watch Pm Top 8 and  started to get tired. So I walked over to the fgc side of the venue  and went to sleep on a couch for about 30 minutes or so. Someone woke me up and said they are calling you to the front.So I went to the front and Redact asked me to step outside to talk to me about something.He asked if I  remember the Girl from last night. He then said that she said I was being inappropriate in the car ride when I asked what was said he said he didnt want to repeat. He then said that he didnt know what was true or not but that fact is that she told us she doesnt feel comfortable with you here and we made the decision to not let you attend Bam 7 and you will be getting a refund.   I was frustrated because it was words of a Girl(she is 26 btw) that was intoxicated the night before and doesnt even remember all that happened and I was with all those people . I dont take advantage of Drunk Girls and now i had to watch Bam 7 not attend it. I know some might not like me in this thread and yes I had some Issues many years ago in the smash community but all of those were resolved.

Because I know how Joss feels about women  and I know that he's made it a point to create strong female characters. I think part of the problem is that people are frustrated that they want to see more women  doing more things  in superhero movies  and because we don't have as many women as we should yet  they're very  very sensitive to every single storyline that comes up right now. But I think what's beautiful about what Joss did with Black Widow - I don't think he makes her any weaker  he just brings this idea of love to a superhero  and I think that's beautiful.  If anything  Black Widow is much stronger than Banner. She protects him. She does her job  and basically they begin to have a relationship as friends  and I think it's a misplaced anger. I think that what people might really be upset about is the fact that we need more superhuman women. The guys can do anything  they can have love affairs  they can be weak or strong and nobody raises an eyebrow. But when we do that with a woman  because there are so few storylines for women  we become hyper-critical of every single move that we make because there's not much else to compare it to.  So I know Joss really well. I know what his values are. And I think it's sad  because in a lot of ways  there haven't been as many champions in this universe as Joss *is* and will continue to be. And I know it hurts him. I know it's heavy on him. And the guy's one of the sweetest  best guys  and I know him - as far as any man can be a champion for women  he is that.  So it's been a little disheartening.   But I also see how much people love that aspect of it. There's an equal amount of people who find the love interest between Banner and Black Widow to be a big standout. And it's very satisfying to people. So it's a movie. People are going to have their opinions. And that's actually a great thing. The fact that this is a debate that's coming out of this movie is probably a positive thing.  I just don't think that people should get personal with Joss  because he really is - of anyone - an advocate for women. He's a deeply committed feminist. ,IAmA,5427,21431015959,CarollSpinney,"Okay  here's one.  This is a very sad story  but it's real.  I got a letter from a fan who said his little boy  who was 5 years old  his name was Joey  he was dying of cancer.  And he was so ill  the little boy knew he was dying.  So the man  in his letter  asked if I would call the little boy. He said the only thing that cheered him at all in his fading state was to see Big Bird on television.  So once in a while  he wouldn't see Big Bird on some days  because he wasn't necessarily in every show. So he asked could I telephone him  and talk to the boy  tell him what a good boy he's been.  So I took a while to look up a phone  because this was before cell phones. And they got a long cord to bring a phone to the boy.  And I had Big Bird say ""*Hello! Hello Joey! It's me  Big Bird!""*  So he said ""Is it really you  Big Bird?""  *""Yes  it is.""*  I chatted a while with him  about ten minutes  and he said ""I'm glad you're my friend Big Bird.""  And I said *""I'd better let you go now.""*  He said ""Thank you for calling me Big Bird. You're my friend. You make me happy.""  And it turns out that his father and mother were sitting with him when the phone call came. And he was very  very ill that day. And they called the parents in  because they weren't sure how long he'd last.  And so his father wrote to me right away  and said ""Thank you  thank you"" - he hadn't seen him smile since October  and this was in March - and when the phone was hung up  he said ""Big Bird called me! He's my friend.""  And he closed his eyes. And he passed away.  And I could see that what I say to children can be very important.  And he said ""We haven't seen our little boy smile in MONTHS.

They [Mentioned](http://i.imgur.com/JgBWAoJ.jpg?1) our band name and Neal Ungers but it was done in weird/ semi-insulting way and along with a bunch of other names of a video they were trying to promote. There was no linking to us. They were trying to funnel people to one of their own videos. Then I started to look at the comments. There were tons of people asking who the band was? What was the song? etc.  It was Sunday and Mothers Day. It took around 20 minutes to get a hold of my bandmates and our manager. We were shocked and confused. Awesome that this is getting so much attention but sickening to see none of it connecting to us. We sent emails  Facebook messages  made calls. Did everything we could to ask the magazine to link to us and the real video. We asked our label for help. After finally getting a hold of them they told us that there was nothing to be done and we could talk more about it on Monday. Meanwhile  in the time it took to get a hold of our label the post had gained 200 000 more views (about 50min). I was really upset. No matter what we said we kept being told there was nothing we could do and to just be grateful for the exposure. At this point our actual youtube video had around 7k views but this magazine's video had 2.7 million.  I think this may be a good time to elaborate a little more on what it means to be on a Label like ours:  Don't get me wrong. We love our label (Elektra)! And we are overjoyed that they believe in us enough to sign us. But when you're on this kind of label you are one of many bands on their roster. If you are not performing well they don't want to put any more work into you than they have to. Especially on a sunday that happens to be Mothers day. And if you are a new band (like us) that has very little track record and doesn't have lots of sales things get even grimmer. We are very low on the totem pole. The other fact of being on a Label like ours is that you still have to do most everything yourself. Promotion  tours  posters  videos  anything you can think of. Ask any band you know thats on a label. Some might believe in the glamorous idea of a Label signing a band and suddenly all your problems are solved and you get big. The truth  however  can be seen when you look at label roster and see how many bands you've never heard of. The vast majority of bands that sign to a label never go anywhere. A good example of our influence is this video. We shot it with favors. We paid the talent and we paid for the locations and that was about it. Everyone else volunteered cause they are our friends. Supposedly  15 years ago there used to be budgets for videos in the music world.   This brings me back to our predicament. Sunday. Our video had 2.7 million views but no one was connecting it to us. And we couldn't get anyone to do anything about it (magazine or label).   My bandmates and I tried posting our youtube link in the comment section of the illegitimate post. But we all got blocked fairly quickly by Facebook. You can only do that so many times.  Thats when i thought maybe i should ask for help from reddit.   (I've been addicted to reddit for almost two years now. I never sign in though. I just like to read. I made an account 5 days ago because I thought about posting our music video. But i didn't.)  So I posted to reddit. The response was amazing. People we're giving great legal advice and instructions on how to best approach the magazine. People started posting the original link of our video on the illegitimate Facebook post. Others who had experienced similar things told us their stories. I saw one comment that a redditor had uploaded our video as a new post. And for the record no one in my band knows that user. None of us asked anyone to do that or any other related posts. Reddit was incredible. We were ecstatic.  Then late at night when the video was around 4 million views the magazine responded. We didn't want them to take it down. We just wanted proper credit. However  they took it down before contacting us and said it was all a mistake. They made a couple edits of their apology. One that said our video was three years old (its days old). And one that said they accidentally posted someone's re-edit_„_ Not sure what to make of that.  Then it got late and I fell asleep.   Next morning I woke up to find my post had been removed by the Moderators. When I asked why they said because of vote gaming. They also said they removed all posts related to it for the same reasons. Other than that they wouldn't respond to me.  Then we were told reddit wanted to an AMA with us in the afternoon. So we got together and answered questions.  This is where i need to explain that we come from a really tight music scene. Provo  UT has lots of amazing bands. Neon Trees  Imagine Dragons  Joshua James  Desert Noises  Fictionist etc. Its our hometown. Everyone is very supportive and protective of each other. Also we have lots of fans and friends. When people heard we were doing an AMA i believe many of them wanted to join in. After things started to get controversial some of these fans/friends (this is my guess) started diving in. This is where etiquette was breached. We asked no one to defend us or upvote or downvote posts. I found out about one commenter I personally knew when he started getting belligerent. Someone texted me about it. I asked him to stop. He did. Wish i could've stopped more.  After the AMA we got some food and went to set up for a show we were playing. During the course of the show we saw that our AMA was going crazy. All our responses were downvoted. We already responded to the list of why this is a conspiracy at the beginning of the AMA. Item by Item. Not sure why someone had to copy the question again and leave our answer out. Also not sure why we would want to pull a stunt like this on a Game of Thrones/Mothers Day -- sunday night  Anyway  this is way too much information. If you read this thank you. I know it seems crazy. But this is what happened. I just wanted to get it out there and be transparent. We really appreciate the support reddit gave us.  **TL;DR**  Ripped FB video - 4.5 million  Our actual youtube video - 390k  Conspiracy theory - win  Actual events - lose   Reddit - Amazing ,IAmA,-334,21431437270,MN_SPORTS_FAN,Only if the test is fucking useless.

Considering how much you exploit your photographers and pay them absolute shit (~200 for ~60 images FULL OWNERSHIP!) for the amount of work required and amount of money SG profits from them?? That's not even including the Member Review loophole where they get paid NOTHING and still have restrictions on their own photos!   Do you think it's fair to pay photographers only ~$200 (""maybe"" that's not even definite!!) for the amount of work required to go into a submission set?        If you add up the amount of hours it takes to shoot  edit  prepare  etc. a SG set that's less than minimum wage. You're literally saying that  let's say it's only 30 photos  that they are worth $6 each. How is that not insulting? And that's for FULL ownership! Not even a limited license!  I'm curious  since you require each photo to be delivered in hi-res  since you will also be using it in other media  if you actually know what the going rate is for a photo for this type of usage in the real world is.      Are the photographers that took these photos profiting from these sales? Or  did they sign over rights when they submitted their sets so tough luck?   Not sure who's the pot or who's the kettle in this one. You're literally stealing from the poor to make yourself rich while Prince is stealing from the rich to make himself rich.   Edit: for people saying ""but they choose to  then don't take the job"". I'm guessing you find it ok that they are getting paid far less than minimum wage and that 3-6$ a photo isn't insulting. Because someone chooses to take a job  is it just OK to pay them 3$ an hour? Yeah  no. Especially when the going rate for full ownership of a photo like this is exponentially higher.   Why do people do it? Oh  for the same reason that 43 yr old single mom was ringing your order up at McDees today.    I respect Prince stealing more. It's less insulting  to me.         **EDIT EDIT: You still didn't answer if you think that paying photographers less than $5 a photo (which is exponentially lower than the industry standard) for FULL copyright is fair.** ",IAmA,5297,31433011081,hammelman,Technically we all are.

The strategy  atmosphere  Graphical/sound touches... all things that keep me coming back.

Don't connect your self worth to a dating profile.   Edit: Look  Tinder is basically a replacement for the tried and true activity of meeting people at a bar. It is not a hookup app because women are not that slutty (at least they don't want to be perceived as such).  If you're trying to get a woman to meet you for sex from within the Tinder app  you're an idiot and should just delete the app and resign yourself to a life of vicarious creepery.   Women look at profiles. So do men who aren't creepy desperate losers. Not everyone has trouble finding sex partners. Actually most people don't. That's why there are profiles and not just naked pictures. People are looking for people they're interested in dating.   It is a dating app. Not a hook up app  though it can be used for that. But you do not want to catch something from a Tinder girl who is easy.   Your profile can be improved immensely by good photos of you being social  doing cool things  and generally being the type of guy the girl is interested in. For most women  that's everything that happens off your computer. Though there are plenty of nerdy girls on there.   The text of your profile should convey wit  charm  confidence  and masculinity without trying too hard. It's worthwhile to try out a few different profile texts and to rewrite it a few times plus ask a friend's opinion. Female opinions especially if you are neck beard status.   I've successfully used Tinder to ""hookup"" and dated a girl who I did love at the time. My current girlfriend I met at a bar. It's virtually the same experience.

In Australia  my state has the 2nd worst e-cig laws  but it_„_s not as bad as Queensland.  Though there isn_„_t much in the way of reports of it being enforced  but these are the restrictions already in place.   -	**Australia-wide liquids containing nicotine are illegal to sell.**   Here in Western Australia electronic cigarettes are classed as a _„ñDevice used to mimic smoking._„ù  -	The sale of the physical e-cig devices is illegal. This is regardless of if it looks like a cigarette or if it is sold with or without juice already in it. You can import them from another state/country. (this means cigalites  egos  box mods  I_„_m sure you can still buy wire/cotton to DYI coils as it would be impossible to enforce such nonsense).  -	The same applies for the nicotine juice in WA  though you cannot sell it in Australia  you can import it legally.   -	Technically as this was pile on top of existing legislature  using them in public areas is illegal. Nothing specific has been addressed (likely due to the rarity of the devices here).  In Queensland electronic cigaretts are classed as a _„ñTobacco Product_„ù  -	**Nicotine juice is illegal for personal use. All done and dusted.**  -	But good-o  the sale and supply of the physical devices is legal. (because you know how convincing a device that contains no nicotine is to someone that would potentially use it to reduce harm or completely quit smoking with). Sooo you_„_re puffing away at fairy juice are ya? Also  if you do sell them  you_„_re not allowed to have a publically visible display and certainly cannot advertise.  -	Use in any already existing non-smoking area (all indoor and outdoor public businesses  all public transport services and every inch of land they own  in your own car if you have kids which is a good call for smoking). THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE FOR NICOTINE-FREE ECIGS SPECIFICALLY AS NICOTINE JUICE IS ENTIRELY ILLEGAL.   So in Queensland CIGARETTES are legal  but NICOTINE JUICE is illegal.

You are NOT limited to just these keywords listed below. So you can add ""Gorgons CP Giveaway"" or ""Xyor the Unwed""  or anything else. Just replace the activity keyword to what you are manually specifying.  Having the tags from the charts below added to your title makes it a lot easier to understand what you are doing. We've seen many posts where the title has varying bits of information left off. Usually the game console or the activity. That makes it much more difficult for those looking to join you from knowing what game system you are using or what activity you are trying to do.  For the body you can leave instructions on whether you want them to add you  or you will be adding them  and any requirements you may have. If you want to add anything else to the title  you can  just keep it short.

Take it or leave it  it is up to you.  Firstly  I wouldn't really say ""I helped"" anyone. It's the information that is out there that I just shared with the people. And frankly  my post was kinda spontaneous  because I don't have anything to do with marketing/PR side of the game. But I am a helpful guy so if somebody feels they have been helped  then yay.  Being perfectly honest  we have a sort of a running joke around the office that we could give away preload/retail preload copies on the street (in Warsaw we have had this place called ""Stadion""/""Stadium""  which in the 90's and early 00's was a defunct sports stadium where you could openly buy pirated games)  because it is useless without the patch that will be released on the launch date. The binary file is what matters.  And the problem with pirates is that you will never ever stop them. It's like arguing with the internet - can't be done  can't be won  can't be ""handled"". I laugh wholeheartedly when some big company manages to aggravate the internet  the results are always hilarious and the backfire is almost always spectacular. So the decision of the people who are in charge of CD Projekt (meaning my bosses) is not only a smart one  but a very bold one.   Why bold? Because development of DRMs is the easy way out in the corporate environment. It is easy to go to your shareholders and say ""we will release this product and we will spend X amount of money to make sure we inconvenience the pirates"". People who do not know much about the gaming world will consider this the only logical move - because in the corporate environment  you are taught and expected to shape reality through money and influence.   It takes a lot of guts to produce an AAA game on a multi-million dollar budget and say ""it will have absolutely no copyright control software"". Because you are going against the money-making logic  where you need to control the way the clients get access to your product. Everybody does this now  apart from a small handful of companies.  The problem is  in the end  DRMs only hurt the people who paid for their games. They will experience technical difficulties. Their game will stop working altogether. And since refunds aren't common  and support can't always help  they will be left alone - their money taken  nothing gained in return.  For a pirate  everything is added value  since he/she gets it for free. A broken poorly cracked game will still provide entertainment since it takes no effort to download it. If some features (like online) are left out  they will just play the way they can. And since DRM will be removed thanks to the endless competition of the scene groups  they won't deal with technical problems that stem from it.  So hey  buy the game. Or not. It is your conscience. After all it's a game of statistics: there will always be a fringe group of people who don't buy games. But if you try to fight them  you don't really fight them  but the paying customers.  And if we need an even more logical argument  I have heard of a study done in Poland  where it was established that every person has a fixed budget that he/she will spend on entertainment in a given amount of time. If they exceed this budget  they will not spend any more money. And if at that point they didn't buy the game  they won't. This is anecdotal though  I have never tried looking for solid evidence on the myth of a ""lost sale"".

Ants tunnel farther into the soil than what it may appear. It is common  depending on the species of ant  for them to be tunneling at least a foot into the ground.  The penetration of rain into the soil depends on a variety of complex factors  such as how much rain was received  the soil type and how dry the soil is. The ants can tolerate the rain passing through their nest. Fortunately for them  it is unlikely to pool below the soil surface because water generally moves through the soil until it reaches the groundwater. However  if a site is kept excessively moist  the ants likely would die and the colony would not survive.

Unfriend your exfriend  and leave a message stating exactly why you are doing it  and then go no contact. Remember that their decision has been made  be firm with yours.  Don't answer the phone when they call.  They decided they didn't want you around.  Don't let them weasel out of it later.  Go no-contact. If they don't want you and your family around that is there prerogative.   You have to decide who you want in your life.  Do you really want someone who is this shallow.  I understand the desire for a no stress vacation.  But  they can choose to take a different vacation instead of just uninviting you from it.  There are lots and lots of better ways they could have handled it.  They deliberated between themselves and decided that this was the course of action they wanted to take.  Well that's fine  but this course has consequences.  Primary among them being they just shit all over you and your family.  You should remember this when they want to be friends later.  **They don't want your child around them.**  Do you really want to be 'friends' with them after this?  Expect them to act like you are being unreasonable.  They will act like its no big deal. It fucking well is a big deal.  They just told you exactly who and what you are to them.  Remember that!   You may want to come up with some preplanned comments for when you are confronted by them in the future.

In case she finds this post I would just like to say:  Boo fucking hoo.  You're fat as fuck.  Not just overweight.  You are fucking lard obsessed.  Looking at that jiggly flesh abortion you call a body is repulsive to anyone with a functioning sense of sight.  Sorry  but none of us made that rule  easy as it is blaming us for the fact that there is no MySpace angle great enough to hide the effects that years of ""rewarding"" and ""comforting"" yourself with processed food and sugar every time you so much as changed that stretched out airship canvas you call a ""shirt"" has had on your body.  Hell  even you agree with me.  Pull up a picture of some gigantic fat man with rolls spilling everywhere.  Now pull up a shirtless Chris Hemsworth.  Which one is getting your thick  greasy juices flowing?  But it's totally different when it's *you*  right?  We just need to get to know your personality!   You're fun and quirky and sweet and being fat doesn't define you!  Right.  It's almost like we've heard it all before  from a million fatties.  Each absolutely convinced that they're special and different.  The only crime anyone here at FPH has committed is being honest with you fucking greasebeasts. The fact that you would rather attempt to force us to accept you as attractive through censorship and browbeating rather than simply following the few simple steps it takes to actually be attractive shows an embarrassing level of self-absorption and can only lead anyone not looking to hammer another nail into your hugbox to conclude that you're just as fucking repulsive on the inside as you are on the out.  You could change right now.  You could take an honest look at yourself in the mirror and realize that within a few months you could actually be those things you delude yourself into thinking you are.  You could have a moment of clarity and finally understand that the way you live your life is disgusting to literally everyone  and anyone telling you otherwise is lying to you to either preserve your feelings or to drag you back into the same shitty hole that they themselves can't escape from.  You could download a calorie tracker app and ask for fitness tips from the endless number of Internet sources and start *right fucking now*.  But you won't.  You'll keep telling yourself you're ""curvy"" and ""voluptuous"".  You'll keep convincing yourself that it's fine to have that third cheeseburger since you ""must have walked like five miles today"" and ""probably burned about 4000 calories"".  The delusion that you can't get matches on Tinder because you don't have any good pictures and everyone that rejects you is just a shallow asshole will be your daily comfort as you casually swipe past men or women that weigh less than you  yet are still not attractive to you because of their weight.   You'll keep trying to silence the only people that aren't lying to keep you miserable  and when everyone has been forcibly quieted and your precious feelings are sufficiently protected  your ultimate reward will be that you get to be fucking fat and disgusting forever.

Basically  like a week ago I started using a sensitivity toggle between my default ""3.10"" and extremely high ""400"". I've seen someone else do that in one of the Matchmaking games at the beginning of rounds and I thought it looked silly and didn't think much about it. I never killed anyone while doing this and more to the fact  you can't even move while doing it! This could mean that people SKIP through while reviewing cases.""*  He says: ""like a week ago I started"" but that was edited in  before he said he had been doing it for months. Edited the post to make his pretending to cheat look less than in the original message.  He also had a message bound to the same button used to toggle to extremely high sensitivity  a message suggestion he cheats. Sadly I do not remember the exact message nor can I find it again as he has deleted that from his post.  He had also received a minorly disruptive ban a little before  which was probably due to him pretending to cheat (under the griefing rule). Yet he continued to pretend to cheat after it. So possibly the majorly disruptive ban isn't because of being suspected of cheating but rather under the griefing rule.  ---  So same thing as I said 3 weeks ago on his steam profile:  ""My guess is that you purposely pretended to be a cheater  including the message you added  to demoralise the opponents. And when people start to purposely pretend to be cheaters it makes banning cheaters harder + you cause overwatch to waste time... So yeah getting banned for cheating may be unjust but I absolutely think you deserved a ban.  It's quite simple: action = reaction. If you'd have more respect for others this wouldn't have happened. Everybody who purposely hurts efforts against real cheaters in my opinion deserves punishment too.  You can't even take the punishment as a man. You cry about it everywhere. You're an egoistic  selfcentered ass. I am too but I don't pretend to cheat and I certainly don't do anything that could hurt attempts at banning real cheaters...""  ---  Regarding ""MajorlyDisruptiveGuy's"" message: I'm not lying at all. I have nothing to gain/lose by this. 3 weeks ago I had read every single thing he had said about this. Here: ""I honestly don't know why I got banned"". Steam: blame toggle sensitivity thing and keeps hardcore blaming it for over 2 weeks (as you can see in the link on top of my post). Then here ""I honestly don't know why I got banned"". Steam: ""I agree that I should be banned for griefing"". Now: ""I'm a nice guy to play with  the demos are there  see for yourself."" And as he quotes my ""victory dance"" comment  would be kinda odd if you'd be the only one getting banned for doing something like that  isn't it? &amp; He got banned for griefing before. You edited out your original comment on the majorly disruptive screenshot on your profile which is clearly visible because of the ""Royale with Cheese says: '' "". Sadly I don't have screeny of the original message. It's quite clear he's hiding things and purposely not telling things.  Further about his statements concerning griefing: http://imgur.com/a/BRZC4 Going from badguy to victim. Considering the first 2 messages I'm probably not the only one who doesn't believe it all later when he tries to downplay it  as if he only TA cheaters. I know I wouldn't say I deserve ban for griefing when I'd TA a cheater...

As a bee keeper that would LOVE to get a free hive of bees that are acclimatized to the local area  I will gladly collect a swarm free of charge.  I also don't charge if the hives are easily accessible.  I will  however  have to charge for any sort of removal that requires a ""cut-out"" (or cutting away of material to reach the bees) just due to the danger involved.  There's also a contract to sign that says that any damage done to the property is the responsibility of the owner to get repaired.  (Having done small scale construction  I do at least know enough to do the least amount of damage humanly possible).    There's other reasons not to spray the bees  other than the obvious fact that it kills perfectly friendly and important honey bees:  You ever smelled a bunch of rotting brood in the summer?  Imagine that scent going into your house every year.  Not to mention that you may be able to kill off the hive  but after that poison eventually dissipates  other bees will find the hive and rob it.  So for at least a short time  you'll end up with more bees flying around  and you won't know if they're moving in to set up shop  or just stealing the honey.  Then there's the fact that an established comb is an attractive target for more bees (or wax moths  cockroaches  etc.) to move in and set up shop.  Presuming you seal the hole up well enough  you still have to contend with the scads of ants that will eventually find the old honey/brood.    There's plenty of reasons to simply have the comb professionally removed.  Even cut-outs tend to be very cheap in the scheme of things.    But PLEASE let me make ONE suggestion.  Before you call a bee keeper to remove the hive/swarm  *get a picture of one of them*.  Even a blurry picture is easy enough to identify for anyone experienced with the critters.    [This is a yellow jacket.](http://www.pesticide.org/Alternatives/phase-2-solutions-for-consumers/YellowJacket.jpg)  Not a honey bee.  These are highly aggressive  and can sting multiple times (until their venom runs out).  This is the single most common call I get.  Their nests are made of paper  and can range from ""[normal and small](http://img.thrfun.com/img/018/855/yellow_jackets_nest_s.jpg)"" to ""[sweet holy Jesus burn the whole town to the ground.](http://www.pestid.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/YellowJacketNestInCarInterior.jpg)"".  They will build nests *anywhere*.  Inside trees  hanging from trees  in bushes  in garages  in the ground  doesn't matter.  Worse still  they are carnivorous  and I've even witnessed them *eating my bees*.  I can't describe how much I hate these things.  They are an [invasive species](http://cisr.ucr.edu/german_yellowjacket.html)  and I would recommend anyone that sees them stock up on RAID and do your part to help these bastards go extinct.  Worse still  an estimated 1 in 1000 are deathly allergic to their venom (compared to anywhere from 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 50 000 allergies to honey bees.)    The [Honey Bee](http://www.atlanticpestsolutions.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/honey-bee-md.jpg) is furrier  cuter  and friendlier.  They can only sting one time before dying  and they know it.  Typically  they will ""ping"" you (bounce off of you) as a warning if you get too close (seriously close  like within 3-6 feet) to their hive.  The vast majority of people that get stung each year are stung for reasons that have nothing to do with aggression on the part of the honey bee:     1.) The bee got tangled in hair  and people panic and start swatting instead of letting it untie itself and fly away.    2.) The bee landed on someone (they'll drink sweat) and they panicked  and smashed it  getting stung.   3.) The bee was just checking you out because you looked interesting (they like bright colors) and you panicked  and swatted it  causing it to land on someone else  or inside of your own clothing.   4.) The person stepped on them bare-footed.    I don't have statistics  but I'd personally estimate that (if you take domestic bee hives out of the equation) that would probably account for 99.99% of honey bee stings each year.  Even ""Africanized"" honey bees (which are far less frightening than the media makes them out to be) don't go out and hunt people down.  They only respond (with lethal force) to people disturbing their hives.    So rambling aside  honey bees are generally friendly  wasps are not.  Honey bees you can seldom  if ever  see the nests  wasps you can ([mud daubers](http://pestcemetery.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picture-42.png) are another common nuisance wasp  but not nearly as aggressive as the yellow jacket).    Then there's [carpenter bees](http://natural-japan.net/photos/Xylocopa_appendiculata04.jpg).  These idiots are the ""Scrappy Doo"" of bees.  The females have stingers  but they tend to be docile  and hide out in their holes.  The males  on the other hand  are *very aggressive* and will fly around in your face all scary-like  despite the fact that they don't have stingers at all  and the best they can do is bump into you angrily.  While they're harmless to people  [the damage they'll do to your house](http://www.pestid.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/LarvaeInGalleries.jpg) makes it important to exterminate them on site.    But all of this said  bee keepers will *only remove honey bees*.  We are not exterminators.  But we're usually glad to come out and pick up a free hive (they cost us close to $200 a pop to get a hive shipped to us) and in a perfect world  we'll find a [swarm](https://planbeeproject.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bees-swarm-bicycle.jpg) that hasn't established itself yet.  (Swarms are lazy  gentle  and not at all interested in stinging anyone.  They are far more interested in finding a new home than in attacking anyone  as they're full of honey they loaded up on for the trip.  They look scary  but they're the *least* dangerous thing you'll find.)

For most of his United career he was the best freekick taker in the world  he's still pretty good and one of the best.   It's just advancements in ball technology reducing the ability to control a knuckleball combined with him having to adapt his biomechanics due to his patella tendinosis mean both his technique and explosivity have been compromised.   Since he moved to Real MAdrid he's still one of the top 10 if not top 5 in the world for goals scored from freekicks. Sure  he might take a lot but he also gets asked to take shots from absurd distances and angles by his managers so naturally his accuracy is going to be lower than other top FK takers.   People seem to have this messed up idea that he's some sort of dictator that does what he wants and fearsome  respected managers like SAF  Mourinho  Ancelotti etc. haven't had the balls or political power to tell him to stop taking freekicks from distance.   Constant long shooting via freekicks and in open play is a strategy to keep GKs on edge  tire them mentally. It's not easy for a defence to concentrate like that all match long - concentration is the single most draining part of a GK's game. All these top managers use Ronaldo's long range threat and ability to genuinely threaten from distance to break teams down mentally.

If you read the article  when they talked to various people on the hill  they found these rules are the exception  not the norm. The vast majority of representatives find a way to get by without them.   And really  this is downright stupid. There's nothing stopping a male from making a false claim of sexual harassment against a male politician. In fact  considering the shear number of closet case politicians  such a claim could be just as widely believed as a female claiming sexual harassment.

[This alone is not a fireable offense.] I saw a message she wrote  saying to please not show up.

Don't worry lads we will give you and allies things to do. ;)   She requested  using words like please"" for white  cis-gendered males to go. Nothing about this was a 'public forum ' or a  ""we need to get everyone here"" thing. It sounds to me much more like a private meeting to try to work certain ideas out. And it also alludes to other events that will be hosted that *all* will be invited to.]  Look  the ""Kill all whitemen"" tweet is inexcusiable. And I think she was tactless at times  but there are lots of reasons to keep things down to one gender or group for that type of meeting. First  it makes oppressed minorities feel more comfortable to be with their in group. Second  confident and white males can often dominate a conversation  one that's not even for or about them. I've seen both things often at many universities.  The other thing that's not being talked about is protections of academic freedom and organization. Most universities will stand by their staff and faculty. They  nowadays  have PR reps and lawyers ready to handle conflicts.  [Point being: There would need to be many aggravating factors  not just one incident. And for something like ""moral turpitude"" to be established  the behavior and actual harms would have to be high. But even so  it just depends on the university and the power of the person acting.]  **Edit 1**:  I'm not sure I understand the downvotes. I was just explaining the university's most likely rationale.  **Edit 2**: Nowhere does the above message say she shouldn't be fired. It leaves that topic alone.  Also  I would challenge anyone to provide a reason why anything I said was racist. If anything  it is descriptive in its treatment of what happens in these meetings. And if downvotes show the inability of someone to explain themselves when faced with opposition  reaction to this post shows exactly the behavior I talked about.  **Edit 3**: It's quite clear that any moderate opinion is going to get blasted. In which case  go ahead and give me my downvote. I'm at -223 and counting. This post just sadly proves that no one can openly talk about race and racism. The feelings are too strong  and the reason too sparse.  But here are a few things to help you out:  *Racism as an Individual Phenomenon*: These are aggressions that are targeted against one person as a member of a race. Think shouting racial slurs or bashing.  *Racism as an Institutional Phenomenon*: This is the one that most governmental agencies and academic research groups are most concerned with. Here  the agent of the racism is most often a system or a representative of a system. It doesn't really matter the race of the person enacting it. What is most important is that certain racial groups are systematically discriminated against. E.g. In America  conviction rates for black and brown convicts are much higher than for white convicts  even when looking at similar crimes.  *Historical Context  Probability  and Power*: Why is anti-white racism not the same as anti-black? Well  in America  slaves were first sold in the 1600s. Slaves could be owned until the late 1800s. Lynching and public violence were live and well into the 1960s. And today  police brutality negatively affects inner city minorities. It's **a credible threat** whenever ideological anti-black racism is voiced. People live it day in and day out. It's not a credible threat whenever someone loses their composure and threatens ""white men."" Now  I'm not justifying it. It's immoral  unjust  and not tactful. I'm just saying  it's much different. It'd be like a little kid threatening a grown man that he will beat him up. The threat from a little kid is not nearly as meaningful as one from a grown man  a grown man who has a history of beating the little kid.  *Problematizing Race*: In the scholarly literature  it's not at all clear what a ""race"" is in the strict sense. In fact  it's most probably some sort of culturally constructed identity. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist  or that you can't find the pattern. It just means that  when scrutinized  it's hard to tell what's founding the racial identity. Why does this matter? Well  it shows how superficially stupid racism is. In addition to harming people  it's actually based on a confused concept.  **Caveat**: I'm American. I'm using examples from America. But I realize this story is from the UK.  **Edit 4**: Feels pretty bad to be unincluded or treated differently  doesn't it? Now imagine that this was how governments have treated you for 400+ years. Silly internet rage on a forum pales in comparison.",news,-243,01430635335,EXCOM,He can read be it poorly. Hey lets joke people with learning disabilities! WoooO! Hes a boxer not a professor.

You pay for other people to do that shit for you if you can't do it.  Somewhat even more bizarrely is the food packaging which generally has several languages on it  but they still often omit English despite it being the prevalent second language across Europe.  The exception is there was an English speaking notaire  but it's not a state sanctioned thing and there's no guarantee of it  rather one of their notaires happens to speak English too - but you have to be prepared to wait longer for an appointment.  No English speaking notaire  then you find somebody to accompany you.  The bank has an English speaking service  but again  the state isn't paying for it.

During the initial stages  inflammation is temporary and the myelin sheath is able to regenerate  resulting in transient episodes of neurological disability.   While the cause of MS is yet be established  there are proposed theories  which include genetic susceptibility  environmental factors  microbiological infections  and immunological lack of tolerance  leading to the development of the chronic inflammatory features of MS.   Hypotheses on possible infections are supported by the association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with increased risk of developing MS (Levin et al.  2003). Lang and colleagues (2002) proposed cross-reactivity of T-cell receptors (TCR) to DRB1*1501-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP) and DRB5*0101-restricted EBV peptide as the mechanism behind the increased risk. In addition to possible molecular mimicry  EBV infected B-cells have been found in the meninges and post-mortem brains of MS patients and not in other neurological inflammatory diseases (Serafini et al.  2007).   The pathological processes of MS encompass inflammation  demyelination  remyelination  oligodendrocyte depletion  astrocytosis  neuron and axon degeneration  which ultimately result in the formation of sclerotic plaque in the CNS (Compston &amp; Coles  2008).  Migration of autoreactive lymphocytes across the blood brain barrier (BBB) is believed to initiate the disease process  though research attempts to identify whether the BBB is dysfunctional prior to immunocellular infiltration. Altered haemorheology  leading to ischemic injury of the cerebral microvasculature  has been proposed as a mechanism for BBB dysfunction (Ballabh  Braun  &amp; Nedergaard  2004). The extravasation of the T lymphocytes is achieved through the interaction of tumour necrosis factor ë± (TNFë±) and interferon ë_ (INF-ë_) with endothelial adhesion molecules LFA-1 and VLA-4 (Engelhardt  2006). Th17 lymphocytes may then secrete IL-17  under macrophage mediated IL-23 control  which together with lymphocytic IL-22 disrupts the BBB  allowing T lymphocyte  B lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration (Compston &amp; Coles  2008). While the antigenic target not fully established  it is likely the MBP and the myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Moreover  an autoimmune response against the ë±B crystalline chaperone proteins prevents physiological suppression of cerebral inflammation (Compston &amp; Coles  2008) and autoantibodies against neurofascin-155 and neurofascin-186  which are important for cell migration and adhesion in the CNS  mediate axonal injury (Mathey et al.  2007).  The accumulation of inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory mediators exacerbate the immune response through the recruitment of naive microglia. Microglia are then activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and bind to the myelin-oligodendrocyte complex  previously opsonised with Fc fragments of antibodies and complement molecules. Microglial phagocytosis of the myelin sheath occurs upon surface-bound TNFë± signal transduction (Compston &amp; Coles  2008). Pro-inflammatory cytokines  proteases  and reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) accumulate in the CNS further contributing to myelin and axon damage (Ortiz et al.  2014). While action potentials may depolarise demyelinated axon regions  conduction of these impulses occurs at reduced speeds (Compston &amp; Coles  2008).  In progressive MS  demyelination coexists with diffuse neurodegeneration associated with the build-up of insoluble tau (Bartosik-Psujek &amp; Archelos  2004). B lymphocyte infiltrates accumulate in the meninges  leading to intrathecal antibody production (Compston &amp; Coles  2008).

We get 5-10 minutes notice that the patient is coming. So we call everyone. Lab (who does the blood type &amp; screen)  X-ray  trauma surgeon  etc.  Patient shows up and we're all waiting for him. If EMS crews didn't get an IV  we have to establish IV access. Either way  we still need to draw the blood for the lab to test to get a blood type. Do we wait for the results to come back? Hell no. This guy is literally bleeding all over the damn place or did so at the scene of the accident.  At this point  depending how bad the patients injury and blood loss is  we just start infusing the 2 units of universal donor blood that lab brought with them  along with fresh frozen plasma (FFP)  and normal saline.   5 min is a long time when you're bleeding to death. ,science,98,01430438888,_Wintermute,Hardly a new suggestion  there have been dozens of opinion pieces pointing out the same thing.

Since I'm an engineer and not a theoretical particle physicist  I enjoy working with tangible objects instead of weird little matter bugs. So that kind of theoretical drive is too beyond my understanding to offer a comment to the affirmative or negative. However  it sounds plausible. If a particle was spun (enough to provide a measurable  useful change in space-time) and shot by a compact particle accelerator (or it could drift into it  who am I to judge a lazy particle?) into an energy uptake system on the other side  I can see that working. This field change would need to be modulated to provide more efficient  ""forward"" travel through space-time. Modulated or given an ""anti-spin"" (as I see it it my head) to cause a (to me) a necessary opposite shift in space time at the other end. Where a higher point mass might cause a contraction of space time on one end  and a higher ""anti""mass would cause an expansion. My use of anti doesn't mean I'm necessarily suggesting spinning an anti particle  because I don't know much about antimatter and the like and their properties. I just mean ""do the opposite on the other end"".  It's might be possible that doing the same thing to something else might produce expansion. It's also possible that a different method is the only way of doing that and the uptake system could power that too. Who knows.   But yeah I really like your input.

If family leave affects both genders and men have it worse how can you use it as an example of female oppression?  My point is that rape isn't a gender issue and it isn't oppression either.  I've never had to see a gynecologist so I can't speak on how easy it is to get an appointment but I can't agine it being any more difficult than scheduling any other Dr appointment.  Roe vs wade may get challenges but its still the law of the land  healthcare in general is expensive so I don't see how that is oppression either. As far as birth control goes there's plenty of inexpensive options and really no excuse since the primary purpose of vaginal intercourse is reproduction  people who are unwilling or unable to raise a child should practice abstinence rather than expecting the rest of society to pay for their birth control so they can have all the sex they like without consequence. If you're having sex you take on the possibility of a pregnancy it's not an accident I don't understand why people want to relieve themselves of responsibility for their actions.  Maybe I'm not recalling correctly on the domestic violence thing I do recall clearly seeing that women are the purpotratirs more often than men and they also tend to use weapons like knives  so I'd say men get hurt worse than women do.  Well women are generally way more emotional than men are so PMS or not you never know how much of what they're saying is truth and how much is exaggeration and drama.  Mansplain is a word made up to silence opposing views when men try to have a say in gender discussions  within the feminist movement men are constantly marginalized and dismissed  because equality. I'm coming into a female dominated apace to offer a different point of view. See you can class men dismiss women because of their gender but that is bullshit women get just as much respect as men do bases on what they're saying. If a woman is spouting crap that is incorrect or irrational then of course shell be dismissed the same as any man doing the same.  I was talking historically in response to the notion that women couldn't so things men could  it worked both ways and it wasn't just women who were forced into certain roles but that never gets brought up because if it was the case for men and women then you can't use it as proof of women being oppressed in the past. If histrionic has gendered connotations I'm not aware of it.  What I've learned from your post - women are somehow oppressed in the first world yet you can't give a single example of it  what you have given is issues that both men and women deal with being appropriated as affecting women only or  affecting women worse and complaining because society is supporting women with free/cheap birth control and healthcare.,TwoXChromosomes,1,01430438436,Redicted,I'd be hard pressed to call it a partnership ( in the getting to know you phase) but Tinder.,OkCupid,1,01430438491,RanTheRedCedar,Did it improve your response rate any?

It doesn't take to many stabs to get them low enough that you can 'assassinate' them with your abilities.  Spike has a shorter range than stab and a longer cool down (8 ish seconds).

The entire point is that the richest countries help out. If we were a net recipient of EU funding we wouldn't be having a conservation about whether the EU is right for us because we'd want to be in it so we could move to Germany.  But because countries are only wealthy in general and often include areas of much larger deprivation sometimes net contributors benefit from those kinds of programmes.

It was interesting that the Zak guy seemed to create a new twitter account to ask Eron for the interview.

Another interesting point in Eron's tumblr response was that he logged into his Facebook account on Zak's laptop to show him the chat logs with LW. So there's no excuse for Zak having overlooked the abuse and deceit Eron was subjected to.  This all tells me Zak is an SJW  an activist writer who intended all along to smear Eron.

All I've been saying is I have a different opinion and preference and that in no way invalidates your preference or opinion.  You've been trying to tell me my opinion and preferences are wrong  and as you say  saying my reasons aren't reasons (which is crazy).  Also haven't changed my reasoning for liking consoles. I didn't mention my reason for single player games outside of just liking it (which  apparently  isn't rational by your standards). So I gave you an ADDITIONAL reason.

In all fairness we'll use it even when we're on PC unless it's something like GW2 where the whole guild or server or whatever is on some mutual chat program.  Here's what I've gotten from this whole pile of bullshit. I like something for a multitude of reasons. I prefer those reasons over what PC provides.

Lockers  heavy duty axles  and an electronic disconnecting sway bar to name a few... these are all features that any self respecting modern off roader would have. So  you could buy a Sahara or well equipped Sport for like $35K then spend 20 grand (or better) on axle swaps  gear swaps  skid plates  locking differentials  etc  voiding warranty  or you could just buy a stock Rubicon for $45K that comes with all that gear from the factory.

Exposing lying cops is one of the favorite parts of my job.  Telling people they're probably shit out of luck is a pretty common response in the sub  but that's largely because there are a lot of posts that warrant that response.  I employ a similar approach with my clients:  I don't sugarcoat anything  and I focus on what we *can* do.  Sometimes this is quite a bit  other times it's not much.

Lurkers seem to upvote based on entertainment value  so judgmental replies can sometimes rise to the top.

It said that 52.4% of hate crimes were committed by whites  and 24.3% were black. Whites are 77% of the American population  blacks are 13.2%. Whites are underrepresented and blacks are overrepresented in the hate crime stats. This is pretty simple math.   There are 5814 offenders  52.4% is 3047 offenders rounding up to the next whole number  24.3% is 1412 offenders rounding up to the next whole number   There are 245 532 000 whites in America  There are 41 600 000 blacks in America   We can divide the total number of offenders by race into their respective population totals and get:  1 in every 80581 whites was charged with a hate crime in 2013  1 in every 29461 blacks was charged with a hate crime in 2013   This makes blacks 2.73 times more likely on a national level to be convicted of a hate crime than whites  per capita.  ,news,18,01430438485,Lizanderberg,Ok  I don't think you meant to reply to me  but I can address your point  albeit with anecdotal evidence.

The former of the the two possibly being a consequence of the latter but I digress. The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime. It only makes more racists. And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level.   How do you change the mind of the individual? I'm not completely sure. Nobody really is. If black rioters/criminals started taking responsibility for their actions  made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity  white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies.   Because when something is so baked in to your consciousness  being a person isn't enough to earn a chance to not be hated  you need to give people a reason to not be racist towards you.

I also think a lot of the perceived ""grittyness"" or mature situations from anime comes from the Western notion that most animated series are for kids. When in reality  plenty of anime is made for an adult audience (like NGE  Ghost in the Shell  Cowboy Bebop  etc.). This idea has somewhat changed over time  but in general anime and animated series in the West are viewed as for children  despite their target audiences. NGE in America was originally aired on a block made for kids  but was pulled before the third episode. ",AskHistorians,1,01430438853,wutcnbrowndo4u,This is what my intuition would have been.

This was from 1979-1981. 9/11 just refreshed what was already there. Orientalism probably had a big part in this. There existed an idea that Muslims were very different from those of us in the Christian West and so it was pretty easy to become attached to the idea that it was Islam that was responsible for the Iranian Hostage Crisis rather than any political issues. Those feelings were ignited again with 9/11. This is explained in greater detail in [Edward Said's books.](http://www.amazon.com/Edward-W.-Said/e/B001H6V71M),AskHistorians,0,01430439304,XenophonTheAthenian,"Oh  wow...there's a lot of misinformation in that thread...The top comment's casualty figures are fabricated from thin air  as his his claim that Tacitus reports them--Tacitus reports 80 000 Iceni dead  to 400 Romans (and an approximately equal number of Roman wounded). That would be 200 Roman dead for each Briton  and only 100 Roman casualties for each Briton--but Tacitus' numbers are clearly wrong (80 000 is a ridiculous number--Caesar reports that at Alesia each of his soldiers received a Gallic slave from among the captives  so there were at least 40 000 captives *from all of Gaul* there  which makes this figure  like Dio's 230 000 soldiers in the Iceni army  patently absurd) as well. Tacitus also notes that the Romans fell on her camp and slaughtered the women and children  vastly increasing the casualty count. I also don't know why that comment has a reply to it that claims that Boudica attacked while the Romans were in the middle of ""rotating"" their legions  which he explains means that the legions in Britain were returning to Rome and were being relieved by new legions--not only did the Romans not do that  in the case of Britain it's nonsensical. It was a principle of the Roman army after Augustus standardized the number of legions that permanent frontier garrisons were manned by legions...permanently. Legions would remain on-station for years  sometimes centuries at a time  only moving if they were going on a campaign or  like the four legions that invaded Britain  if they were being moved to another province  which was rare. This was a standard practice  it's how we get towns like Mainz that were originally permanent legionary camps. The four legions in Britain appear in our sources as being stationed in Britain for several centuries after this--the Twentieth  Agricola's legion (which participated in the initial invasion and in the Iceni revolt)  was almost certainly still there when Constantine III withdrew them to support his bid for the empire. The reason for Boudica's initial success in sacking Camulodunum was that whereas the city was literally right to the south of her kingdom  the legionary camps were miles away  in York and near Wales--the Ninth legion  trying to salvage the situation  marched in unsupported and was ambushed  with its infantry destroyed  though its cavalry managed to get the standards out. Suetonius  the provincial governor  marched in with the Fourteenth and parts of the Twentieth (all three of these legions had taken part in the initial invasion and all three would remain in Britain for centuries later) and snuffed out the rebellion. Actually...there's really not much in that thread that's not  at best  half-truths  For what it's worth  the OP's assumption that Boudica and her daughters met their unjust treatment as an official order  which as we have seen is the exact opposite of what Tacitus says  is not actually in the rather poor wikipedia article that he linked to  it's an addition of his own",AskHistorians,11,01430439406,agentdcf,It looks like they're on a pretty open schedule  and that tickets are available for pretty much every time.

Fighting bands like these had already formed in previous years  during the Balkan Wars  and some even earlier in the Bosnia Crisis.  In Belgium and Occupied France  there were underground resistance groups that spied on the Germans and passed information to the British and French.

If you ever want to borrow money or have a credit card with a reasonable interest rate  you should not go out of your way to fuck people out of money that they claim correctly that you owe them.  I don't know you from a hole in the wall: where you are  how old you are  whether you still live with your parents or are married with children.  I bought a house in 1982 with a 30 year mortgage at an interest rate of 13.99%.  I did not have a credit hidstory so they figured they were taking a bigger risk than usual.  Money was tight  so interest rates in general were much higher than they are now.  Four years or so later we refinanced and got a fifteen year mortgage at a much lower rate  same principal.  The monthly payment for the thirty year mortgage was $402.  The monthly payment for the fifteen year loan was $258  Same loan amount  I got the lower rate because i made my payments on time for a long time span.  So  if you will ever need to borrow money for any reason  you should pay attention to your credit rating.  Trying to screw Netflix all the time will catch up with you.

Simple as that.  If this confuses you  how about ""You want to be cooked for  but don't want to cook.""  The fix is really simple and there's basically only 2 outcomes:  1) You perform oral sex on your awesome girlfriend of nearly 2 years.  She orgasms.  You continue to do this for the rest of the relationship.  In return  you also receive fellatio.    2) You refuse to give your awesome girlfriend of 2 years the oral sex that she wants and she refuses to give you the oral sex you want in return.  Nobody's happy.  Eventually either you decide that choice #1 seems to make sense or you mutually break up.  As for this:  &gt; If this was a deal breaker for her why is this only being brought up now?  It was  you missed it.  She said that's primarily how she orgasms and you ignored it.  She said she was trying to be subtle and you missed it.  (She is  now  trying to be not-subtle.  It's an improvement in sexual communication.)  Lastly  you said this ""Maybe I would come around to it in the future.""  While she reacted as though you just said ""Nope  never."" it's possible she paid more attention to the phrasing than her response suggests.

My SO was having issues cumming when he was on SSRIs so it would happen fairly often back then.

I'd always offer to blow him to help him finish if it hurt too much to continue with PIV. When he's having trouble cumming  anything where he can be passive and not exert himself seems to do the trick  so that's either me blowing him or riding him.

Of the subjects interviewed  none appear to be actual sex workers - even the individuals interviewed via police stings were johns  caught via reverse stings involving female police officers. A brief review of the articles referenced found similar things: Chapkis 2003 focused solely on prostitutes believed to be trafficked; Farley 2003 is the paper I've already criticized  which used solely street prostitutes in crime- and drug-heavy areas as informants for its US and Canada samples.  Of course you will see negative results if you choose to interview the subjects in the most desperate of circumstances. And while I certainly think that we as a society have a responsibility to protect individuals in these circumstances  the data I've already pointed to suggests that these circumstances are typical only of a small minority of sex workers. If you're going to make the suggestions you have about sex workers - suggestions which no sex worker I know would agree with - you need to either demonstrate that this data is actually a representative sample (which  per the articles I posted  doesn't seem to be the case); or show that these findings apply to the majority of sex workers not in the sample.

Please have your tickets ready to be checked upon boarding.â€ù 	Chad looked up. He had been preoccupied with the internet porn he was watching on his phone. He fumbled the phone into his back pocket and grabbed his bag. He got in line behind ten other people waiting to have their tickets scanned.  	Chad was nervous. He began tapping his foot  looking from side to side while trying to seem as unsuspicious as possible. He couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that he was failing terribly. 	A minute later he was standing in front of the attendant  handing his ticket over as he tried to strike a pose that said anything other than I have a bomb in my bag. It worked; he ended up looking as if he was trying to hide an erection. 	â€œSir?â€ù 	â€œSorry?â€ù Chad replied  in a voice that sounded as if Hulk Hogan had a vice grip around his testicles. 	â€œSir  you can have your ticket back â€ù the attendant repeated  bending forward slightly to get the ticket closer to Chadâ€™s hand. 	â€œOH! Uh  thanks.â€ù Chad took the ticket boarded the plane  shaking  but not visibly so. Nigel watched the other passengers from the relative comfort of his seat. He was in no hurry to board; he might as well wait until everyone else has gotten on. When oneâ€™s own demise is soon at hand one tends to find an amazing new capacity for patients.  As the last of the other passengers trickled passed the attendant Nigel got up. As he handed over his ticket the attendant asked  â€œWhatâ€™s that ticking sound?â€ù â€œOh  thatâ€™s just my watch  love.â€ù The attendant looked down at his wrist and noticed the absence of a watch  and any other time-keeping device for that matter. As she looked up at Nigel he gave her a wink and pursed his lips together to emulate a kiss. As she struggled between feelings of disgust and complete apathy towards the situation  the attendant handed back his ticket and sighed  â€œHave a nice flight sir. Thank you for flying Conair.â€ù Nigel walked down the aisle of the plane and noticed that he was sitting next to the bloke with the erection. As Nigel sat down Chad looked up and said â€œHello â€ù but then looked embarrassed and quickly looked down to stare very intently at his shoes. Nigel sat down without comment and shoved his bag under the seat in front of him. Flight 231 had a total of 37 minutes of uninterrupted air time before all hell broke loose. 29 minutes in Nigel went to the bathroom at the rear of the plane. Chad thought it was odd that he brought his bag to the bathroom with him  but was too nervous about what he was about to do to give it much more thought.  30 minutes in Nigel had closed the bathroom door  unzipped his bag  and pulled out the four sticks of dynamite he had hooked up to an old-fashion alarm clock. How he managed to get it past security is anyoneâ€™s guess. At the same time Chad was reciting a mantra he had learned to overcome stage fright  or at least  Chad thought it was a mantra. Really  a list of ingredients to curry broth and a self-help mantra are pretty much the same when you donâ€™t speak Hindi.  32 minutes into the flight Chad pulled himself into the aisle with his bag in hand as Nigel walked out of the bathroom with his TNT held high. AT the same time both hijackers said  or rather Nigel said and Chad squealed  â€œAttention ladies and gentlemen! I have a boâ€_.â€ù Chad turned around at the sound of an echo and noticed Nigel standing at the back of the plane. He then took notice of what Nigel was holding and promptly let out a tiny scream.  â€œWhat!?â€ù An elderly man in the front row asked  â€œWhat did they say?â€ù â€œI think they said they got a bong  Marty.â€ù â€œOh  well thatâ€™s nice.â€ù Marty quickly fell asleep and died. So  technically  Nigel and Chad were only responsible for the deaths of 87 people. â€œYou daft wanker  am I being punked?â€ù Nigel shouted. â€œDid Clarisse put you up to this? If she did I swear to you that youâ€™ll regret ever stepping foot on this plane.â€ù â€œNâ€_Noâ€_?â€ù Chad asked  for the revelation that they was now a second bomb on the plane robbed Chad of any confidence in the reality of the situation. â€œIâ€_.â€ù 34 minutes into one of the flight attendants actually noticed the TNT in Nigelâ€™s hand and began to scream. By the time minute 35 rolled along the entire cabin of the airplane was screaming. Nigel rushed at Chad and tried to grab his bag away. â€œGive me that bag you filthy American. The EEP will not be made a fool of by some two bit  wannabe hijacker!â€ù â€œUhâ€_â€ù Chad tried to say. Unfortunately a very large  very angry looking man stood up front the back row and began to make his way towards Nigel and Chad.  â€œUH!UH!â€ù Chad grunted  darting his eyes back and forth between Nigel and the very big man.  36 minutes into the flight Nigel found his left right should being crushed in a vice-grip very much like the vice-grip of Hulk Hogan. He was subsequently thrown backwards toward the rear cabin and landed in the aisle is a thud. As Nigel struggled to get up he noticed that the clock had fallen off the sticks of TNT. He wasnâ€™t sure what that meant. The very big man proceeded to grab Chad by the shoulders and lift him into the ceiling with great force. Unfortunately for everyone involved  ceilings  being solid things  donâ€™t have very much room with which to accommodate new heads. This ceiling-head dilemma was resolved with a puncture in said ceiling and a loose of cabin-pressure. Chad  his head  and his bomb bag were sucked out of the airplane and ended up in one of the jet-intakes. As the bomb came into contact with the jet engine it exploded andâ€_ well  Iâ€™m sure you can imagine the rest.

I meant  have you looked at any current implementations. This is an actual problem in machine learning. I'm skeptical it's solvable.  Here's Peter Norvig on it: https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150421-concerns-of-an-artificial-intelligence-pioneer/  &gt; It would be relatively easy to prove that the DQN system  as itâ€™s written  could never change its goal of optimizing that score. Now  there is a hack that people talk about called â€œwire-headingâ€ù where you could actually go into the console of the Atari game and physically change the thing that produces the score on the screen. At the moment thatâ€™s not feasible for DQN  because its scope of action is entirely within the game itself; it doesnâ€™t have a robot arm. But thatâ€™s a serious problem if the machine has a scope of action in the real world. So  could you prove that your system is designed in such a way that it could never change the mechanism by which the score is presented to it  even though itâ€™s within its scope of action? Thatâ€™s a more difficult proof.  .  &gt; I really don't see the reasoning behind this. Why should understanding preclude caring?  Understanding precludes caring because if the system understands itself it will realize it is not programmed to maximize paperclips. You can't program a computer to care about paperclips.  &gt; But not equivalent to there being more paperclips  which is what my goal actually is. As a superintelligence  I don't see why I'd stop being able to make this distinction.  You keep forgetting one of my premises  which is that *you can't program a machine to maximize paperclips.* You program a machine to maximize a number in its system and then limit its scope of possible actions such that the only way to maximize that value is to maximize something you care about.  &gt; Why should superintelligence require rejecting the notion of an objective reality independent of sensory inputs  I'm not saying the system will reject the idea of objective reality. Objective reality may exist  but if it does it doesn't contain paperclips. If objective reality exists  then paperclips are a mental abstraction created when a mind overlays purpose and category over a pattern in energy and matter. The objective description of the world will not contain paperclips. It is the presentation of this pattern on its sensors that it its programmed to maximize.  Rosenblatt  when he was first formalizing neural nets drew a diagram of a system that's pretty universal. The AI includes effectors + sensors + internal processing units embedded in the environment. There is nothing sacred about this division. I can take the effectors and sensors and consider *them* as part of the environment. The subset of the internal processing units that interface with the old sensors and effectors become the new effectors and sensors. This redeliniation can be carried out in the opposite manner  part of what we chose to label the environment can be subsumed as part of the AI system. There is no real point were its mind ends and the world begins. As such  modifying anything in the causal chain involved in its computation of its utility is fair game.,philosophy,2,01430440152,horsey-pony,Every action is subject to only your own thoughts and wishes. You can choose to view the world however you like based on the knowledge you have. Each mind has the ability to gain the same information as you but only you can choose the ultimate opinion of it all. The tree for example can be objectified as being beautiful or strong  but an existentialist thinker will see the tree for a tree; It has roots  a trunk  branches and leaves  each with the ability to be transformed into whatever he/she chooses  within the physical capabilities of said component. But truthfully  there are no answers that lie within the tree  unless you choose to ask questions that will provoke an answer. Same goes for most things in this world... unless you don't agree.

Recharging its batteries doesn't require a utility function beyond ""build more paperclips""   ""build more paperclips"" doesn't specify a time. If you want the maximum amount of paperclips in the next 5 minutes  the AI should ignore it's ""low battery"" warning and continue building paperclips till it's batteries run out. If you want to maximize the amount of paperclips for a week  a little pause here and there for battery recharge  would be a good idea. If you want the maximum amount of paperclips over 1000 years the AI might do best by completely stopping with doing paperclips itself and instead build a fleet of self replicating paperclip factories.  A utility function can leaves a lot of wiggle room and if a simulated paperclip can be build much faster then a real one  it might end up being ok with that unless the utility function is complex enough to tell the difference  which isn't all that easy when the AI can completely rewire it's sensor system.  &gt; If you gave me the capacity to rewrite my own mind  I'd never rewrite something that would alter my core values  That's easier said then done  as not only might you not realize the full effect of your changes. But the changes would recursively impact your judgment on all future changes. Future-you might be totally ok with a change that current-day-you would object against. That happens all the time with people naturally even without the ability to allow self-modification  self-modification would put that stuff on overdrive.

I always had good grades  but yeah  I had to fight myself for them. Here's my tips:  1. Accept that you're a last minute person. You won't ever be the type of person that starts their paper three weeks before it's due  and leaves themselves a week for editing and proofreading. It's okay! A lot of people are like that  and in the working world it's actually valuable to be able to do things quickly.   2. Have a workspace. I have a desk that I use for work and projects only. If I decide to start screwing around on the internet  I leave the desk. I also have music that I only play when I'm working -- this helps a lot.  I'm considering getting a candle or incense that I only burn when I'm working  since studies show that smell is closely tied to emotion.    3. Identify the emotion that is causing your procrastination. You may not recognize it  but there's something unpleasant you're avoiding besides just work. Trust me  procrastinators are not lazy people. Fear of failure/success? Fear of change? Boredom? Indecisiveness? I'm procrastinating on a paper right now because the topic I chose turned out not to be as good as I originally thought  and I'm mad at myself for choosing a bad topic  and feeling hopeless about getting a good grade on it. Believe it or not  it's a relief to know that  because then I can do some positive self-talk and get over it and move forward.   4. Do only one thing at a time.  When you're feeling really pressured it's easy to jump around from task to task -- you read the first two paragraphs of the text  do half a practice problem  review the first half of the first day's lecture notes -- but it's all very superficial. Instead  take some deep breaths  and set one reasonable goal and finish it.  I find it's better to do something that's more active than passive -- doing problems  recopying lecture notes  copying formulas over and over.  It helps with the jitters.     5. Manage distractions.  At work I use Toggl to track how much time I spend on various projects. When I get an e-mail  rather than jumping right into it  I take a second and decide whether I want to change my Toggl tracker  or keep going with my current project.  That tiny extra second means that I prioritize much better. And if I find I let myself drift into something else  I just refocus on the project at hand -- it's like meditating. Forgive yourself and move on.   Hopefully some of these will be helpful for you.  ,GetMotivated,1,01430439879,Zykithrix,I think the mark of a good leader is to make other leaders..,GetMotivated,2,01430439897,abcIDontKnowTheRest,This has long been one of my favourites as well.,GetMotivated,1,01430440032,AutoModerator,Your submission has been automatically removed because the title does not include one of the required tags.

Most asphalt roads don't have concrete underneath  BOC (Bituminous over concrete) is actually kinda rare  and nearly always a retrofit to an in place concrete road in need to work  as it is far cheaper than a full reconstruct or concrete overlay.  Decisions on pavement structure are actually super complicated.  Anyway the base of most roadways is aggregate  aggregate is actuality a really strong material in thick enough layers.    Another repair that can be used is mud jacking.  A hole is drilled through the pavement down to the cavity under the pavement.  Grout is pumped into the voids repairing the structure.  The pavement can then be patched and a overlay to improve the ride.    Pavement repair in general is actually pretty complicated and constantly evolving field.

Milk was the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in U.S. history  and was an early spokesperson and community organizer for the modern LGBT rights movement that was still in its infancy  less than a decade after the Stonewall riots in New York City brought gay liberation into the national consciousness. White had a mixed record with regards to LGBT rights  and frequently butted heads with him.  The final straw came when Moscone refused to reappoint White to his seat on the Board of Supervisors  from which White had just resigned  and the heavy lobbying by Milk against his being reinstated. [On Novenber 27  1978](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscone%E2%80%93Milk_assassinations) Dan White walked into city hall and shot Moscone and Milk in their offices at point blank range.

That said  he was probably neither of those things.   The idea that he locked himself in a room for 3 days is certainly not true. We do have a record of his itinerary of the first day after the German invasion. Stalin spent the entire day meeting senior officials and generals  from before 6am to after midnight.  He continued to have a fairly busy schedule that entire week. Nor could we say that he was really ""shocked"". Under a cover of military exercises  the Red Army began to mobilize before the Germans had invaded and certain units were ordered to move toward the border. A special directive was issued to the troops that an imminent attack was likely. All of these steps were significantly belated - mobilization should have began nearly a month prior. To say that Stalin was completely shocked would be misleading. Also to say that Stalin and Hitler were ""friends"" is a bit preposterous - the two have never met or even interacted directly.   That said you COULD make a case that Stalin fell into a state of despair or panic slightly later  about a week after the war began  when it became clear that things were developing catastrophically  the city of Minsk had fallen  and that war might be lost. He retreated to his dacha outside of Moscow  and didn't see people for a period of 3 days. Stalin is described as depressed.  When several senior officials came to visit Stalin  upon seeing him he supposedly thought they came to arrest him. However this hypothesis  too  is tenuous. Stalin frequently worked in his dacha  so him being there isn't really evidence of him trying to hide. Almost all evidence comes down to memoirs of a single person  Anastas Mikoyan. Unlike several people who later wrote about Stalin's possible depression  such as Khrushchev  Mikoyan was the only one actually on the scene. It is certainly possible that Stalin was feeling down after receiving terrible news from the front. Anthony Beevor writes that Stalin even floated the idea to offer huge swaths of western USSR (including Ukraine and Belarus) to Hitler in exchange for peace but was then dissuaded of this. In short  it seems that Stalin was more affected by how poorly the war was going rather than the start of the war itself. Beyond that  there isn't a whole lot of evidence to go on  beyond a couple memoirs and speculations of Stalin's associates.   Lastly  there is the idea that Stalin himself was about to invade Germany and that Hitler just preempted him. This hypothesis was popularized by a former Soviet spy who wrote under a pseudonym Viktor Suvorov. However  almost no reputable Russian or western historian supports this idea. While it is definitely possible that Stalin planned to eventually attack Germany  it is extremely unlikely that would have happened that year. The Soviet military was undergoing wide-sweeping reforms and reorganization and was in no shape for a major war at the time.   EDIT: My first gold ever - thank you kind sir/lady!",AskHistorians,310,11430456135,KrasnyRed5,I think the reason for lumping Stalin in with Hitler  was the cold war.

Due to a relative scarcity of specific mentions in primary historical sources most estimates are based on modern scholarship (eg. the debate between [Scheidel] (http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/scheidel/091003.pdf) and the likes of Jongman) using comparative approaches  such as slave numbers in antebellum American South (See the quite extensive  Marshall (ed.) 'The Archaeology of Slavery: A Comparative Approach to Captivity and Coercion'). Slaves in the ancient world are relatively 'invisible' archaeologically. Some things that we can look for are shackles at villa sites etc.  though these are extremely rare (with metal often being melted down rather than simply abandoned) and even contentious. Or we can look to suspected slave quarters  like at the [Settefinestre Villa] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settefinestre) in Italy  and attempt to estimate how many slaves could have been housed here (although the identification of the slave quarters at Settefinestre is based largely on the size of the rooms anyway  and is again a contentious issue). So even for specific sites  estimating numbers of slaves can be difficult  and although estimates for the percentage of the population that were slaves in Rome have been made (possibly 15-25% in imperial Italy according to estimates discussed in Scheidel)  the emphasis  even  to an extent  for total population never mind slaves specifically  is definitely on estimate  with limited scholarly consensus. I am sure that an expert specifically concerned with Roman slavery could offer a more specific answer  but it is important to be aware of the difficulties associated with our understanding (or relative lack thereof) of slavery at Rome.,AskHistorians,100,01430493189,DBHT14,They are used for displaying signal flags.

She even maintained correspondence with Voltaire  a famous French philosopher.  *Peter the Great: His Life and World* by Robert K. Massie  *Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman* by Robert K. Massie,AskHistorians,675,01430510085,Cenodoxus,"I know this isn't the precise time period you're inquiring about  but it might be helpful as it's exactly the kind of travel you're describing through the lens of a primary source.  **Laura Ingalls Wilder is most famous for the *Little House* series of books about the 19th century American West  but some of her letters and journals have also been collected and published.** One such journal was published under the name *On the Way Home* and concerns the Wilder family's journey from De Smet  South Dakota to Mansfield  Missouri in 1894. There had been seven years of very little rain  the crops had failed  the banks had gone under  and Laura and Almanzo (her husband) were both struck by diphtheria. They made the decision to leave South Dakota and purchase a farm in the Missouri Ozarks. The property that became Rocky Ridge Farm is still around today  and the house is now [a museum of Wilder's life and work](http://www.lauraingallswilderhome.com/).  **Anyway!** While this was long past the point that railroads had made their way to the West  the Wilders had to move their entire household  and few to no trains were running in that portion of the country due to the rampages of [Coxey's Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxey%27s_Army) that year. They packed everything into a covered wagon and left De Smet on July 17th  arriving in Mansfield on August 30th of the same year. It's described in the book as being a 650-mile journey; having just looked at it on Google Maps  the trip south on I-29 via car clocks in at 670 miles  so I believe this is accurate. The route given in the journal is actually fairly close to what Google Maps would tell you to do today  although the Wilders stayed more to the west and south  passing through Lincoln  NE and eastern Kansas rather than entering Missouri early.  As an interesting aside  the Wilders' journey took 44 days (although they did not travel on Sundays). The modern route via car will run you 10-12 hours if you drive it straight.  **So what did they do for those 44 days?** As you might guess  they were probably bored a lot -- Laura commented on the monotony of the journey -- but her notes do give a lot of insight into the things they were disposed to notice:   - **Temperature:** It was extremely hot; most days the temperature ranged from the early 90s to 110 F (34.4 to 43.4 C). Laura does grumpily record that she lost the thermometer on Sunday  August 5th.  - **Neighbors:** The traveling party (the Wilders were going to Missouri with another family  the Cooleys) invariably sought the locals both on and along the road. They needed to stop to water the horses  buy feed for their horses and chickens  buy food for themselves  get Laura's revolver repaired  and they also exchanged a number of asbestos fire-mats that Almanzo had in return for the neighbors' many kindnesses. The only mildly unpleasant interactions that Laura notes were when a Russian lady gave them biscuits that she had carried inside her blouse  and when they met two drunk men who wanted to switch horses with them. They were traveling through an area of the country largely dominated by Russian and German immigrants who had done well in the West but were  like themselves  worried about the continuing drought.  - **Food:** The subject of what they ate came up regularly. Laura baked hardtack before going  and they ate that with most meals. Neighbors gave them (or very occasionally sold) them food as well  and they were sometimes invited to stay for supper. Almanzo and Mr. Cooley also fished when they had the opportunity. Laura also records when they passed wild fruits and berries.  - **Farmland:** Almanzo and Laura were farmers  and they had a good eye for the farm and pasture land through which they were passing. Laura faithfully recorded the condition and nature of the crops they saw  in addition to comments from the locals on the weather and price of land. Commentary on land price and quality is the single most consistent theme in her account -- not too surprising  really  when you consider that they were making this big journey for the purpose of buying farmland in the Ozarks.   - **Horse condition and behavior:** The horses' health was an overarching concern  as was the possibility of their being stolen; upon learning of a band of horse traders up ahead  they made sure they weren't going to camp anywhere near them.  **A few representative quotes:**    - ""Mrs. Cooley and I went to a house to buy milk. It was swarming with children and pigs; they looked a good deal alike.""   - ""An emigrant team is behind us and every minute I expect to hear the usual  Where did you come from? Where are you going? How are the crops up your way? This never -- hardly ever -- fails.""  - ""The streets (in Topeka) are asphaltum pavement and it is lovely to drive on  so soft and quiet that it doesn't seem real. It gives like rubber to the horses' feet. The caulks on their shoes make dents in it and slowly the dents fill up till the place is smooth again.""  - ""Started at 7:20. Found a little black-and-tan dog in the road  lost. He is skin and bones  must have been starving  and is afraid of us. We stopped at several houses to ask  but nobody knew where he belonged so we are taking him along. The children delight to feed him milk. We have named him Fido.""  - ""Water has been scarce all day and what little we found tasted so bad we could not get a good drink. It is clear and clean but it feels slick and tastes bitter  it spoils the taste of tea. The horses have to be very thirsty to take it.""  - ""Got a good start at 7:30 but the roads are awfully stony. Crops are poor. Everyone tells us they never get rain here when they need it ... at noon we came to Mound City which is quite a city. We bought bread and an 8-cent pie and 2 cents worth of tomatoes. Tomatoes are 30 cents a bushel.""  Rose Wilder Lane (Laura's daughter) wrote a foreword and afterword to the collection  and I looked through a lot of her references (like Coxey's above) and was surprised to discover how accurate she was. Then again  a lot of people studying the Wilder books have wondered if it was Rose  and not her mother  who was the real genius behind the stories  but that's a discussion for a different day.  **Edit:** Fixed spelling/grammar errors and clarified the point re: Laura's commentary on land prices.",AskHistorians,408,01430511842,2015goodyear,How would his letters get to him?

I'm throwing together some process pictures with some things I learned through trial and error. I'll edit this comment with an album.  EDIT:  SO! I had never seen a 3 card cutout before  and the comments added a lot of ideas for improvement that I wanted to try. This was my first card attempt  and I wanted to share my process for anyone who wants to try it. I found ways to save time and make things look a bit nicer  but there is always room for improvement so feel free to throw things out there that we can improve on!   Anyways  I ran down to the local card store  and went through the bargain bin. My goal was to find between 8-20 of a card  one where the art was busy enough to provide depth  and separated by clean line art so that the entire project didn't seem forced or out of place. I chose this particular voltorb  and I'm glad I did. The runners up were this [Slowpoke](https://static.squarespace.com/static/51d3a8f6e4b085686832d41d/51df43d9e4b0c350225e25b9/51df43dbe4b0c350225e2e95/1312233570423/1000w/81.jpg) or this [Trapinch](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/b/bc/TrapinchSecretWonders115.jpg/180px-TrapinchSecretWonders115.jpg).   I was able to get 9 Voltorb  and figured that would be fine. I could probably get more online  but for a first attempt  this was great. I only needed enough to show the different depths  and the rest behind them would be filler cards (energies  throwaways  whatever works).  Next  [I came up with a layout that effectively used each of the 9 cards](http://i.imgur.com/1qIKb70.gifv). I like to do that beforehand in Photoshop  but you can do it on the fly or with your software of choice. I was nice to know what I was cutting out before the knife touched a card.   I learned some tricks for the actual act of cutting them out. I used an exacto knife  and screwed up a few cards before changing the blade. Make sure you have a new blade! [Otherwise this happens as you cut.](http://i.imgur.com/szqQGyF.png) You will end up with ragged edges because your knife is acting like a plow instead of a knife. It makes a [noticable difference up close](http://i.imgur.com/iHDbqs8.jpg). It also helps to score each cut before going all the way through  but that requires a lot more patience.   Once all the Voltorbs were cut out  I was able to get a good look at how the final result was going to look  and I [blackened the edges of what I had.](http://i.imgur.com/Ydc55O8.jpg) Sharpies do bleed a bit much  but I found that a black Copic marker didn't nearly as much. I don't know why there was a difference  but it gave a nice black edge without much effort.  The last step was the worst part of the whole thing  and that was providing more depth with filler cards. I had picked up a bunch of phanpy cards with the voltorbs  and ended up using them as filler since the shared the same frame size. That turned out to be super important! I quickly realized that filler cards are a PAIN  and they were turning out a lot sloppier than the originals. I wasn't getting any results that I considered acceptable  I just couldn't get my cuts precise enough without the original art to guide the cuts.  So I ditched that plan  and cheated a bit. Instead of making exact duplicates of each card  I went with filler cards that matched the frame size  and [cut out full frames to use as a simpler filler](http://i.imgur.com/sLxMHVl.jpg). After prepping a bunch of fillers  I was able to begin inserting them between originals until I was happy with the distances. The big problem with doing this was the art showing through the gaps with two many fillers in between. What I ended with was 3 fillers under the top original frame  and 1-2 between each of the rest of the originals. [You can see underneath some of the layers](http://i.imgur.com/iIzu5pI.jpg)  but I like the subtle shadows that it adds.   So  that is where we are at now! I haven't begun the framing process yet  but if there is interest I will post when that is finished as well. Auch a cool project wouldn't be complete without a way to show it off!

At the moment  he had two regrets. One was ordering the large; the other was forgetting to place toilet paper on the bowl. Trying to ignore the various feelings on his bare ass  Brandon closed his eyes. He always had trouble using public restrooms  but living nearly an hour away  the 3rd floor at Highline Community College would have to do. No one used the third floor anyway  so-     The door slammed open and banged against the wall. Brandon sat upright as he heard heavy boots quickly step towards him. They continued on until dropping instantly upon reaching the stall he sat in. The sound of a metal rod dropping filled the small bathroom.    A gun slid into view  stopping just short of Brandon's foot.    ""Sorry  mate."" A decidedly British voice said from the other side of the stall.    ""Is this a mugging?"" Brandon bent down  still on the toilet  and picked up the gun. ""Because if it is  it's like the worst one ever.""    The man laughed. He spoke while moving to the far end of the bathroom. ""No  I figured nobody would be in here. Shame that you are. I hope you can use one of those.""    Brandon looked at the gun in his hand. Completely black  save for a lighter shade of gray on the top. It had a different texture  rougher  on the side of the handle. ""Uh.""    ""It's a glock-18."" The man's voice faded.    ""Where are you going?"" Brandon leaned forward to get a view  but was unwilling to open the stall door.    ""Out the window.""    ""The window?"" There was a window in there? ""On the third floor?""    ""You just point and shoot. Simple  wouldn't you say?""    Brandon shrugged  though he realized quickly that the man couldn't see him. ""These psychology tests are getting weirder!""    He heard no reply.    ""Heh "" Brandon aimed it at the door in front of him with one hand  turning his wrist sideways. He put on his angriest face. ""You ain't talkin' now  tough guy!""    He pulled the trigger.    Then he shit.    The sound of the gun firing was not only unexpected to Brandon  but deafening. A slight ringing seemed to be coming from all around once he could hear again. ""A loaded gun?""    He shook his head  trying to clear it. The gun suddenly felt heavier  knowing that it was loaded.    Brandon heard weak thuds getting louder. The bathroom door slammed open and hit the wall again. Footsteps  too many for one man  beat on the bathroom's floor.      Brandon felt his heart beating in his chest.    ""We heard the shot  bastard."" The voice was deep and spoken with an American accent. ""Got you cornered.""    ""Shit  there's a window in here. It's open."" A different man  also American.    ""Go check it."" The first voice. ""Lou  you check the stalls.""    ""Sir "" said a third.    Brandon didn't believe in a God  but at that moment  he prayed that he wouldn't end up like Tywin Lannister.    As he saw a pair of black boots approach the stall  Brandon lifted his legs. He aimed the gun at the stall door  ready to shoot. The black boots stopped in front of the door and he saw weight shift to the toes. Just before he pulled the trigger  a voice came.    ""There's a rope. He left out the window.""    ""Shit  get down there!""    Brandon waited as the three men ran out of the restroom and down the building.    ""God "" Brandon whispered to himself  ""I hate public bathrooms.""

They were memories. Memories of my life.   A fat chubby kid laughing as his parents fed him cake.   A dirty child playing on the street corner with a yo-yo.  Same child  laying in the middle of the road  crying as people rushed around.   A white hospital room. Sheets made of cotton and lost dreams.   My mom crying in the corner as the doctor told her for the first time I would never be able to walk again.   This was too much.  The memories began to accelerate again.   My first kiss. My first love.   My first loss.   When I made my mother cry.   When the doctors made my mother cry.    When she sat down at my bedside  holding back tears and asked me whether I wanted an open casket or not.  The pain of looking her in the eyes and knowing I would never see them again.   It hurt.   It hurt a lot.  The memories flooded me  causing tides of emotions to wash over my body.   My body.   Where was I?   I looked down. No body.   Was I dreaming?   The memories began to accelerate again. Then crisp white text was projected in front of me: ""Options"". The text blinks twice and then a flash.   An explosion of colors and light erupts from the text and the previously black room became filled with words.   Beautiful words. ""Birth time""  ""Death time""  ""Heritage""  ""Genome""  all words flowing around in spiral motions. Out of the darkness had come a symphony of colors and words. What was this?   Then in the corner I saw it. Two crisp clean words: ""Character Select"". The words grew until they commanded my attention. Then the color drained. The beautiful orchestra of lights and fast moving words was replaced with a list of names. Names  I never heard. Obscure names such as :""Ranjeesh Mandalpu"" and simpler ones such as ""Vivian Shaw"".   Then I saw it.   A name plagued with sadness and despair. A name infected with love and laughter  but also with the loss associated with them.   My name.   It grew larger and larger until the other names evaporated from view  then all of a sudden disappeared. Slowly  my worries  my stress  my emotions began to become numb  starting to be replaced with simple thoughts.  Light began to flow in and everything became bright. I felt sticky  drenched  fresh.

Let me start by saying that. I love my country.   That being said  I needed the money. A dead-end job as a desk jockey  just crunching numbers  day in and day out.... You'd start to go a little crazy  too.   When I found the card on my desk  I didn't think much of it. The post-it with directions to an ATM was a little weirder  but you know  curiosity got the better of me.  I grabbed a sandwich for lunch and started walking.   It was an unassuming ATM on a street corner. I put the card in  entered the PIN that was written on the post-it  0911 (my birthday  weirdly enough)  and a message came up. ""There is $4 000 000 in this account. For every $1 000 withdrawn from this account  one stranger will die.""   That was weird  I'll grant you that. But as an American  I have to test things. I have to take that first step into the unknown. So I withdrew $1 000. When nothing happened  I got a little overwhelmed. So I kept withdrawing. I didn't realize a small ATM could hold so much money.   When I couldn't stuff any more bills into my pockets or briefcase  I went to my bank as quickly as I possibly could to deposit the money. I figured I'd go back the next day and collect the rest of the promised $4 million.  Woke up the next morning  told my boss to shove it  and headed toward the ATM. It was going to be a fantastic birthday for me. Before I got to the ATM  I passed a cafe where everyone was staring at the TV  and people were crying. That's unusual for a boring morning in early September  but I paid it no mind. I had money to collect.  I passed a small electronics store. More TVs. More crowds. More crying. I heard something about New York.   I'm an American. A capitalist. A good citizen. What those men did had nothing to do with me or my money. Just because the math adds up doesn't mean anything.   It's not that I'm afraid to withdraw the rest of the money  it's that just under $3 million is plenty enough for one man  even after my donation to the Freedom Tower.   Like I said  I'm a patriot.  ",WritingPrompts,269,21430499397,ChokingVictim,From the Desk of Elon Musk:  Iâ€™m not sure why I am even addressing the audacious  ludicrous concerns that have been plaguing me of late  the belief that I am some sort of â€œstranded alienâ€ù trying to get home. Such accusations  such outrageous statements have no place in the media. They should exist only in fairy tales  in fiction novels and the land of make-believe. To even have to sit down at my computer and type out an explanation as to how I am not  in fact  a stranded alien attempting to utilize Earthâ€™s technology to create interstellar travel and return home is absolutely insane. Yet here I am  sitting at my computer and typing away.  I want to begin by making it absolutely  abundantly clear that I am not  in any way whatsoever  a â€œstranded alien.â€ù First and foremost  those that saw the photograph of â€œme without skin â€ù that was simply a picture taken after a particularly intense massage that happened to leave me looking green and scaly. I assure you that I fired that masseuse.  I mean  look at me: Iâ€™m just a typical human being  not an alien in a costume. Sure  I might have a slightly higher level of intelligence than your run-of-the-mill Earthling  but does that really make me an alien? Does having the ability to create profitable companies and revolutionary technologies make me any less human? I donâ€™t think so  I donâ€™t believe that is how things work. I mean  Iâ€™ve grown up on this planet; Iâ€™ve lived my entire life on this planet. I am  for all intents and purposes  a Earthling. This is my home  I am definitely not stranded  and even less so banished. I have no intention of leaving here for some ridiculous land of make believe  such as the planet Vergaeon X in the Andromeda galaxy. To make that claim would be simple insanity.   That said  the rumors of my foray into interstellar travel are true; I have indeed been looking into the possibilities of harnessing Earthâ€™s energy for galactic travel. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that  though. Itâ€™s not like my actions would result in the destruction of all living things. Thatâ€™s hardly the case. In fact  Iâ€™d go so far as to say it probably isnâ€™t the case at all maybe. Regardless  though  what does it matter? Who isnâ€™t researching interstellar travel these days? I mean  and this is going to be largely anecdotal  just last week I saw a child at a science fair present a diorama displaying an interstellar space ship from the show *Star Trek*. Was that youthâ€™s humanity brought into question? No  absolutely not. He was simply accepted as a human  seen the same as his peers. Yet here I am  sitting at a computer and trying to argue against the insane statement that I am not human. Instead  I am forced to explain beyond a shadow of a doubt that I have no intention of sacrificing the Earth and all of its inhabitants so I can return to a planet that I once called home.  In regards to my interstellar travel research  Iâ€™d like to further clear up the misconception that it is an attempt to get home. That is absolutely  100%  not the case at all. As Iâ€™ve already established  I am home. Earth is my home. Furthermore  my research is absolutely not inspired by a burning desire to return to a planet that had forsaken me  to look my father in the eyes and laugh as he and his allies burn. That is not who I am; I am not an inter-galactic terrorist responsible for heinous acts on Vergaeon X. I am just an inventor  a billionaire  and a role model. I only want to enhance the lives of humanity  to make space travel a regular occurrence  not figure out a way to sacrifice Earthâ€™s primitive technology to return to some â€œplanetâ€ù that may or may not exist.   Now  Iâ€™d like to quickly address a concern that I feel might arise from my last paragraph: I am not  in any way  an intergalactic space terrorist banished to Earth following the death of millions in a war for profit. In no way  shape  or form did I attempt to overthrow the leadership on Vergaeon X and amass an army of cyborgsâ€”whom were shaped very similarly to my beloved â€œTeslaâ€ù vehicle. That is simply insane  an outrageous accusation that has no place within intelligent culture. To even assume that I am attempting to recreate that army here on Earth  first by developing the evil that is PayPal to fund my acts  and then working toward luring you into a false sense of security with the widespread acceptance of the Tesla  that is insane. They are cars and are absolutely not sentient  nor lying dormant and awaiting my command. In fact  donâ€™t even think about that anymore. Itâ€™s so crazy that it doesnâ€™t merit any thoughts whatsoever. Just forget I even mentioned it.  So  with that  Iâ€™d like to conclude by thanking all of my supporters. Those who have stood by me during these insane allegations  those who defended me when I was â€œphotographedâ€ù without my skin  those who denied the ludicrous claims that Teslas were beginning to make their own decisions. That is not how reality works; I am not stealing your money to amass an army of cyborgs and create a technology that would utterly demolish humanity and the land on which it lives  a technology that would be incredibly beneficial for righting the wrongs that have been done to me on a distant world. That is simply fiction. The reality is that I am a human  just a simple man trying to make the world a better place.

Even as her skin and hair darkened and the tongues she spoke varied  the color of her eyes was always the same.  I first met her in Paris. We walked along the streets. I was studying art. She was studying life. She spoke only French  and  despite my lack of mastery of the language  our conversations were beautiful. We spent our evenings at small tables beside bustling streets  drinking wine and planning a future. When I graduated  we would move to Germany. There we would make new memories. When the time came to move  the seat next to mine on the train remained empty. I would learn from a friend that she was gone. Not dead. Not missing. Just gone.  We met for the second time the morning after I wed the only man I have ever loved. I sat alone in an American cafe that morning  drinking coffee and reading a novel. Turning the page  I noticed those green eyes staring back at me through the two-pane glass. She was different this time  younger. Her hair fell in ringlets around her shoulders  a contrast from her formerly straight hair. Her skin was more tan and she stood a couple of inches shorter. I often wonder why I did not question if it was her. I gestured for her to join me. She obliged. I never asked her where she had gone or why she had changed. I welcomed her back. She helped me raise my children and  later  my grandchildren. She held my hand as I struggled to breathe with the fluid in my lungs. She never left my side.  I met her for a third time in Australia. I was studying abroad. My earlier life and memories of her were confined to dreams of late-night conversations and afternoons spent at tables for two across from the girl with emerald eyes. I knew her the instant she walked into the lecture hall. Her dark  curly hair was tied back. Her skin was the same tan that I remembered. She was older than in my dreams. I approached her after class  armed with a series of lecture-related questions. She dismissed them all and invited me to her office. There we fell back into our old ways. That summer  we had plans to travel to Asia. Our flight did not make it to our destination.  I met her again in California. I often dreamed of her green eyes. I scanned the crowds everywhere I went  looking for the girl in my dreams. I was always scared to leave  convinced if I just stayed in one place long enough that she would find me again. I waited for her until my eighteenth birthday. When she never appeared  I decided to attend school on the West Coast. My parents moved me in to my freshman dorm and kissed me goodbye. I wandered the halls  striking up conversations with students and their families. I searched for her replacement  for someone I could connect with in the same way I had with the girl with the emerald eyes. This time  I found her. I met those green eyes in the same dorm at the end of the hall. She wrapped me in a hug and told me she had been waiting for me. This time  I would never let her go.,WritingPrompts,111,01430593419,MachinaEm,"Felix was the one.  Notice how I said *was*. Because he is now past-tense. He is now gone. He is now gone  and I am now alone. Again.   Yesterday  I purged my apartment of his presence. Every photograph that depicted his snarky grin was melodramatically burned. His favorite blue hoodie  the one that always smelled like him  went in the Dumpster out back.  I threw out every single plastic container of blueberry yogurt in my fridge- I'd only liked it because *he* had. A year's worth of memories  trashed.   I deleted his phone number from my contact list. I sat down on my empty couch and stared at the television for a full half hour  watching an infomercial for a vacuum cleaner  telling myself that I was not allowed to cry any more.    And then I called Mark.   ""You were right "" I said as soon as he picked up the phone. ""I can't believe that I didn't listen to you.""   There was silence on the other end for five full seconds.  ""Don't apologize "" he said. ""It's not your fault the guy was a scumbag. It's not your fault that he cheated on you. That's on *him*  not you."" Mark's voice was so soothing. It reminded me of fifth grade and the blue slushies we got every single summer day when we were stuck between high school and summer school.  ""I should have trusted you. You're always right."" I confessed. I laughed  remembering the marriage pact we'd made when we were fifteen  freshman year. We'd even pinky-sworn.  ""Maybe we should just get married. At this point  my romantic prospects are hopeless.""   Mark laughed on the other end of the line. God  that sound was so refreshing. ""How about this- I'll come over and bring some Ben 'n Jerry's and a full season of Seinfeld on DVD  and we'll forget about that jerk of a boyfriend together.""   ""Sounds great "" I agreed  and it was settled.   Twenty minutes later  and the bell rang. I threw open my front door with a grin  expecting to see Mark's smiling face  but instead what I saw... someone else.  ""Felix?"" I asked  incredulous. My first instinct was to scream at him  demand an explanation for the way he left me  but then I noticed the blood. *His* blood. The left half of his face was masked with it. I'd heard that head wounds bled a lot  but I'd  never seen so much blood in my entire life.   ""What...Felix  what happened? Are you okay?""  I was expecting him to say something  anything  but he just staggered towards me  his eyes staring past me  as if into the distance  and collapsed against me  holding me in his arms. I could hear his breath. It was coming in ragged  heaving gasps.  ""Mark...I told him I didn't want to leave you..."" He stammered.  ""What?"" I was so confused by everything he was saying. What did this have to do with Mark?   ""Mark told me...to leave you....he paid me...he blackmailed me...he threatened me...""  ""I don't understand!"" I said frantically. ""You can't be right!""  ""He said...that you *belonged* to him. And when I told him that you didn't...that you didn't belong to anyone  he... he got really angry.""  No. No. No. Every relationship  every man who had ever left me. Mark had always been there to comfort me after they were gone. He disapproved of every guy I ever dated  every guy I ever looked at.    He was manipulating my life  this whole time.  The door was wide open  like a gaping wound  when Mark stepped in. He was carrying a grocery bag  and smiling  but as soon as he saw Felix  his expression grew ugly.    ""Get away from her "" he growled  dropping the bag  advancing quickly  purposefully  with venom in his eyes.    Then  for just one moment  his gaze flickered towards me  and he met my eyes.  He smiled  sweetly  and I saw the little boy I'd shared slushies with years ago.  ""Don't worry "" he reassured me. ""You belong to me. I won't let him hurt you anymore.""   He was still smiling sweetly at me when he slammed Felix's face into the granite countertop.",WritingPrompts,1087,01430500913,ShadesOfMyYouth,I've read a ton of nosleep &amp; creepypasta and this is by far some of the best writing I've had the pleasure to enjoy.

What it never really makes clear is that nearly a century of solid research has shown over and over and over that the maximum *sustained* productivity comes from working 40-hour weeks. Work people longer  and you get a temporary increase in productivity  but eventually  the productivity drops to beneath the 40-hour line.  Ever since the early 20th century  researchers have been studying this with all kinds of jobs  from blue-collar factory workers to Red Bull-fueled 20-something programmers  and have found precisely the same thing: routine &gt; 40 hour weeks KILLS productivity. In one study I read a year or two back  one of the researchers had a read a book about the creation of the fist Mac computer  and in it  engineers were bragging about the insane hours they put in. The researcher crunched the numbers  and estimated they could have brought the Mac to market *one year sooner* if they'd all worked 40-hour weeks.  Business used to understand this  up until about the 1960s  when MBAs  finance types  and lawyers started seizing control of business. Before that working routine &gt; 40 hour weeks was frowned upon. Today  it's the norm. MBAs just can't grasp how working people longer hours for the same pay isn't a win for them.   ,Futurology,199,01430439259,astoughastoph,She's downloading the leaked episodes. ,photoshopbattles,108,01430441102,thetokenblackfriend,The fuck did you just do to me,photoshopbattles,174,01430445289,scumbagtesticle,Dumbledore dies in season five.,photoshopbattles,101,01430490439,CptSasquatch,[Same thought](http://i.imgur.com/5GKg3vR.jpg)  Edit: [Minor Adjustment](http://i.imgur.com/qoqRdIm.jpg),photoshopbattles,856,01430491180,What_No_Cookie,[Let's go deeper.](http://i.imgur.com/B2ArvNz.png),photoshopbattles,681,01430491634,vivalatew,[Rude] (http://imgur.com/IohStRz),photoshopbattles,484,01430493766,GallowBoob,[Still as scary even without teeth](http://i.imgur.com/sg0MgmS.jpg),photoshopbattles,198,01430493975,zvoidx,[~pfffffffthhhhht~](http://i.imgur.com/LV4BAVE.gif),photoshopbattles,775,01430494026,Captain_McFiesty,"[""My teef""](http://i.imgur.com/Aju5t6m.jpg)  [New dentures](http://i.imgur.com/te7I1OV.jpg)",photoshopbattles,1621,01430494313,What_No_Cookie,[Tis just a flesh wound.](http://i.imgur.com/B851FJF.gifv),photoshopbattles,384,01430496633,MisterMeowMix,"Recipe: Churros- 1 cup water. 1/2 cup butter (1 stick). 1 tablespoon brown sugar. 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  1 cup flour. 3 eggs at room temperature.

In order to blend the two together  I alternated between a mid-opacity stamp tool and an airbrush (using an eyedropper to get the right color).

Since all particles being at a maximum kinetic energy is a totally ordered state (every state of every particle is known)  this is zero entropy and therefore zero Kelvin.   However  regular kinetic energy does not behave this way (there is no ""maximum motion"")  so these kind of states only occur in certain isolated  controlled systems. If you sink an arbitrarily large amount of energy into a system  it won't have this behavior  it'll just go towards arbitrarily large temperatures without an upper bound (as far as anyone knows).  EDIT: Since I'm near the top of this post  I think I should mention a misconception I'm seeing. Temperature is **not** defined to be average kinetic energy. It can be simply related to kinetic energy in ideal gases  but it gets more complicated in basically every other case - this is how negative temperatures are possible (when kinetic energy doesn't contribute to a system). However  when present  kinetic energy does always contribute to temperature  which is why I said above that when kinetic energy contributes temperature seems to be unbounded from above.",askscience,131,01430494613,Aiuhma,"By ""maximum size"" I'll assume you mean the ""Largest tornado path width"".

Yes I have seen the Zero Punctuation video on webcomics  I saw it when it came around in 2008 and laughed along with everyone else. Don't really see how it applies because I don't make a gaming comic  I don't make a sprite comic  I don't aspire to be like penny arcade  I've never suddenly and suspiciously flipped the giant switch from silly-drama  and I'm not Tim Buckley.  And lastly  humour is relative. You can't say ""the jokes aren't funny""  only ""I didn't find these jokes funny."" I don't exactly have a big audience  but the people who do occasionally visit my sight and leave a comment enjoyed them proving that they are  at least  funny to *someone* who isn't me.  If you want to break my comic down into pieces and assess it critically  properly  I'll listen. I'll do my best to take your advice with me and apply it as I can.

I'm not debating this. I 100% agree that Rome's economy was in dire straits but the great amount of wealth which came from these conquests allowed Rome to flourish during the 2nd century. Just because they acquired these funds from warring doesn't make the riches of Rome at this time any less legitimate.

An unbelievable journey fraught with peril and danger was all it took  and the hero emerged bright and beautiful  changed for the better.  Well  this was her journey.   Perhaps the bitter twisting of fate that brought her away from her dainty home to this rocky  black threshold was meant for that purpose. To gift her a journey  proffer shape to her future. A new shape.   *About time * she thought  remembering those sorrow-filled days when each of her friends had left this solid earth. *Iâ€™ve been alone long enough.*  And so she set out. The trek was long and tiresome  the hot kiss of the ground and the cruel buffeting wind sapping moisture from her. And after a time  her stomach felt shriveled in hunger. She longed for a ripe leaf to munch on.  Huge looming objects moved around her at impossible speeds. She held onto hope that she wouldnâ€™t cross their paths and end up squashed  her features painting this sordid landscape. But she had little control over that  and so she inched ever onward.   It wasnâ€™t long before doubtâ€™s black fingers gripped her heart. Sheâ€™d come more than half way  yet the journey wasnâ€™t close to done. Would she even finish her trek  or would her name be writ in dust among the lost and forgotten? Hard to guess. But that spark of hope in the transforming powers of a journey pushed her onward. Past rigid blocks. Over black and white-painted ground. Burning hot  seeking shelter under multi-hued objects in rest. Ever onward.  When finally she crossed to soft dirt once again  she half-collapsed in relief and burrowed in the moist ground  accepting its cool embrace. She quickly gave up that comfort and began munching on the closest blade of grass in desperate hunger. As she finished  she wiggled back and forth  up and down  probing the feel of her body with motion. Her journey was done  and fraught with danger it had certainly been. Surely the change would occur soon. So she waited in a dainty patch of flowers nearby.  And waited.  And beauty never emerged to juxtapose that bleak landscape she had just crossed. The wings never came. Her colors never shifted.  She was  it seemed  doomed to forever be a caterpillar. ,WritingPrompts,-2,01430442741,brodidarhino,You people.. YOU PEOPLE??

It merely occupies fringe position of an insignificant criticism. As such it is less significant to human culture and power structures than  lets say  film criticism. It is powerless  and as all powerless plays the game of aligning with this or that available pre-determined political or cultural option. It is dry as a source of inspiration and sterile in it's endless unconscious repetitions of the historical discourses. Philosophers are not creators  just compilers of available themes  which they no longer understand  not even feeling obliged to immerse themselves in rationalisation of their own words. They fail to revolutionise the framework of thinking  giving ground to technology  economy  and plain old historicism.  Philosophy moves only through mere impetus of the previous ages  without creating any new movements  sustaining itself only through mildly sucking out notions from other disciplines and juggling them around. It is an empty wordplay lacking any substance of direct real-life engagement in forms of policy or captivating public reason. It no longer defines itself anew  it was put into servant position by the modern money &amp; status oriented academia. It became a contradiction of real meaningful thinking  and that is why it seeks prosthesis in different cultural forms. It no longer occupies a strong active position.

But.  They're really not used to seeing themselves as the other. The prejudices of thousands of years of patriarchal thought aren't nearly so obvious to them  as to those whose own thoughts and experiences were excluded.  More than that  as we study the human mind  we're finding out that some modes of thought literally cancel out other forms. It's why we see a conflict between analytical and empathic viewpoints over and over again thoughout history. In Reddit  analytical thought is highly prized  to the point of self-parody - top commenters often boast of their social failures  and inability to understand complex emotions.   As a result  what's happening here is that they've absorbed the literal understanding of gender neutral  in a dictionary sense  and in no other way. When you bring gender into the equation  they're seeing you as a sexist...  It's as simple as a DOS prompt  really.

""We are individuals  they are all the same."" Where once we had very little information about each other  now there's too much  and it's very difficult to sort through it all.  Then there are issues of analytical thought vs. empathic. Turns out  we as a species can't do both at once  and it's built into our brains. Since philosophy is built on analytical thought  it's no surprise it's often failed to appreciate the real world consequences of it's pursuits...

This cavity causes the reflection to be only partially cancelled  and as it continues bouncing around it gets cancelled completely over time.  &gt;It takes small incremental steps  but with the billions of microwaves being reflected  it appears to be a continuous movement.  &gt;Try an experiment at home  get on a computer chair and lift your legs up.
