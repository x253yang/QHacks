We‰Ûªd like to make it clear that while it is devastating to have lost our beloved pet  and this tragedy was obviously completely avoidable  an excessive use of force  and a dangerously negligent act on the behalf of the Officer - we would have found satisfaction in an apology  and for the Wyckoff Police to have told the truth surrounding the circumstances that caused this disaster. Unfortunately  the Wyckoff Police have defended the actions of the officer  assumed no responsibility  conducted no official investigation  and have consistently contradicted the reports of the two eye-witness neighbors  as well as the physical evidence at the scene. Very clearly  they are not being truthful  nor accepting liability for an extreme act of negligence.   **WHAT THE POLICE SAY**  Though the Wyckoff Police Department has not yet released the official police report  we spoke to the police chief on the afternoon of 05/01/2015  and asked if he was sticking to the details that he made public through the media. He confidently confirmed that the details of the police report would be consistent with the statements he made to the media on 04/30/2015.   We are told that while dispatch issued a call to 621 Lawlins Rd.  the officer verbally confirmed the incorrect address  stating ‰ÛÏ622‰Ûù over the radio. He was not corrected. The police maintain that the officer then proceeded down the driveway to the front door of 622 Lawlins Rd.  the Vukobratovic residence. He then supposedly knocked loudly  multiple times - finding no one home  he entered the back yard through the unlocked gate  and proceeded into the yard  around the landscaping  to a the patio area where he discovered an open window. According to the police  the officer considered the window a possible point of entry for what he believed to be a burglary in progress  and drew his weapon. It was at this time that Otto  ‰ÛÏlunged‰Ûù at the officer through the open window  attacking his boot. The officer maintains that the dog ‰ÛÏhad him‰Ûù by the boot  and considered his life to be in danger  which was reason for him to fire four rounds at the dog - two of which missed  the other two hit Otto in his back and side.  After the incident  Animal Control arrived to take Otto to the hospital. No investigation was made on the actual crime scene. The officers who arrived on the scene scoured the yard looking for the casings and bullets from the missed shots. No report was made regarding these ballistics  nor were any photographs taken of the scene. The Wyckoff Police department maintains that the use of force was completely justified  as the dog was violently attacking the Officer  putting his life at risk. Despite this  the officer sustained no injuries. The officer remains in active duty.  **WHAT WITNESSES SAY**  Two adult residents and a child were home mid-afternoon on 04/29/2015. Having just had their windows professionally cleaned  the blinds in their home were open on every window. One of the residents was inspecting the work done on the windows and noticed some unusual damage to one of them  indicating a potential point of entry for what could be a future burglary incident. He called his cleaning service  and they denied causing the damage. Not wanting to create an emergency situation  especially with a child in the home  the resident drove to the Wyckoff Police Department to file an official report regarding the damage. He spoke to an officer at the front desk  and was told a patrolman would be dispatched to his home within the hour.  A short time later  a patrol car pulled onto the street in front of 622 Lawlins Rd.  and both residents of 621 Lawlins Rd. approached the front of the house - one at the window  one at the door. They observed the officer exit the vehicle and proceed down the driveway of 622 Lawlins Rd. There were no cars parked in the driveway of 622 Lawlins Rd.  so the residents of 621 had an unobscured vantage point. Moments later  the officer was observed entering the backyard through the gate. Within seconds  one resident observed Otto coming around the corner of the house  barking at the officer. The officer was then observed taking a ‰ÛÏstandard shooting position‰Ûù and firing multiple times at the dog. The resident observed dirt being kicked into the air from at least one of the shots being fired into the ground. Upon hearing gunshots  one resident left the house  yelling at the officer for being at the wrong address  questioning what he was doing. He raised his hands to his head as a gesture of disbelief regarding his own actions.  **EVIDENCE**  The officer claims he entered the property  came around the side of the house  and observed an open window that he believed was a possible point of entry in relation to this ‰ÛÏburglary‰Ûù call. While inspecting the window  Otto lunged from the window  startling the officer  at which point he fired four times at the dog. This is easily disproven. The eyewitness statements are extremely clear about being able to observe the officer firing at the dog near the gate  nowhere near any open window he could have been alerted to.   On Thursday  04/30/2015 Zana Vukobratovic discovered a bullet casing laying in plain sight on the grass near the gate to their backyard. Officers were called to investigate the casing  but made no photograph of its location  handled it without gloves  and did not thoroughly document the scene.   On Friday  05/01/2015  while walking in the yard  Igor and Chris (his friend)  discovered a bullet embedded in the dirt  approximately 18 feet from the entrance to the backyard. The location of this bullet is supported by the statement of the resident at 621 Lawlins Rd. that saw dirt kicked into the air from one of the shots. Realizing that there could very easily be additional evidence still at the scene  Igor and Chris combed the area  and discovered a bullet casing resting in the leaves  mere inches from the casing recovered on Thursday 04/30/2015.  The photo below demonstrates the likely position of the officer at the time of the shooting based on the location of these three pieces of ballistics:  http://i.imgur.com/iYVJOl9.jpg  As you can see from the below photograph  while standing in this position  the officer would have not had a view of the rear patio area where the open window was supposedly observed:  http://i.imgur.com/xre81Zv.jpg  Here you can see how close the bullet in the dirt was found in relation to the entrance to the backyard. The officer very obviously opened fire within the first few feet of the backyard:  http://i.imgur.com/BKgHuB5.jpg  Below is the undisturbed bullet casing No. 2 that was found on Friday morning  05/01/2015:  http://i.imgur.com/blcnBxa.jpg  **MOVING FORWARD**  At the time of issuing this statement  we have not alerted the Wyckoff Police Department to the discovery of Casing No. 2  or the stray bullet. Quite frankly  we are concerned with their integrity  being that police chief does not seem interested in an official investigation. We have sought legal counsel in regards to charges that may be brought against the Wyckoff Police Department  and have determined that we will be pursuing them for damages  which in accordance to New Jersey law  is limited to the cost of Otto himself  and expenses related to this tragedy. Despite their extreme negligence  excessive use of force  discharging of a firearm in a residential neighborhood  and fabricated police report  the officer will only be held accountable by the department itself. If there is enough support from the community  we may be able to drive the point home that we do not tolerate this kind of irresponsibility on our local police force - nor do we tolerate the fabrication of details in order to protect a wildly negligent officer responsible for needlessly murdering a family pet in its own backyard. It is up to us to hold them accountable.  --------  **Support:**  - Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Justiceforotto  - [Petition (has some typos  Igor didn't make this)](https://www.change.org/p/wyckoff-nj-police-department-fire-officer-kyle-ferreria-for-the-murder-of-otto-the-dog?recruiter=11862285&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=autopublish&amp;utm_term=mob-xs-share_petition-reason_msg&amp;fb_ref=Default) ,conspiracy,2673,01430752185,AgainWithRestarting,Do they have the boot that the dog allegedly bit?,conspiracy,975,01430753593,valtastic,"They haven't responded to any of the accounts  haven't returned phone calls  and have deactivated most relevant email accounts  FB comments  etc.   Edit: They actually just deleted their FB page too.

Anyone feel free to repost this content anywhere you find appropriate:  Governments literally create false realities to keep people in conflict. That is so that populations remain fearful of each other and divided and do not unite to overthrow the elites. It is a part of a strategy of tension that has been employed for at least hundreds of years through governments and probably thousands of years through relgions.  It is not natural for people to hate each other like this. We are manipulated into it. The following is a passage from Howard Zinn's ""A People's History...""  &gt;  Black and white worked together  fraternized together. The very fact that laws had to be passed after a while to forbid such relations indicates the strength of that tendency. In 1661 a law was passed in Virginia that ""in case any English servant shall run away in company of any Negroes"" he would have to give special service for extra years to the master of the runaway Negro. In 1691  Virginia provided for the banishment of any ""white man or woman being free who shall intermarry with a negro  mulatoo  or Indian man or woman bond or free.""  from another section:  &gt;  Bacon's Rebellion brought together groups from the lower classes. White frontiersmen started the uprising because they were angry about the way the colony was being run. Then white servants and black slaves joined the rebelå_ lion. They were angry  too-mostly about the huge gap between rich and poor in Virginia.  &gt;  The greatest fear of wealthy southern planters was that black slaves and poor whites would combine in another uprising like Bacon's Rebellion. One tool to keep blacks and whites from uniting was racism. Edmund Morgan   a historian of slavery in Virginia   wrote in his American Slavery  American Freedom that racism was not a ""natural"" feeling about the differå_ences between black and white. Instead  white leaders encouraged a negative view of blacks. If poor whites felt contempt for African Americans  they were less likely to join with them in rebellion.  It's the same strategy gone global. And now that we have instant global communication  they can't just lie about it in the newspaper and trick everyone. They have to actually act it out or find patsies to act it out for them.  Think about it... do you actually have reason to hate anyone? ....or have you only been taught who you should hate? Do you actually know for certain that the individuals in every ""terrorist act"" are actually who we are told they are? Would the people have actually had the motivation or resources to commit an act of terror or were they only able to do it because a government agency enabled it?  These are all legitimate questions.  http://www.sott.net/article/125878-The-Strategy-of-Tension-NATOs-Secret-War-Against-Europe  &gt; Daniele Ganser  professor of contemporary history at Basel University (Switzerland) and chairman or the ASPO - Switzerland  published a landmark book about ""NATO's Secret Armies."" According to him  during the last 50 years the United States have organized bombings in Western Europe that they have falsely attributed to the left and the extreme left with the purpose of discrediting them in the eyes of their voters. This strategy is still present today  inspiring fear for the Islam and justifying wars on oil.  Tufts Professor  Michael Glennon  even explains this in his book ""National Security and Double Government"". The TL;DR is basically that you don't have any choice or right to self-determination anymore because anything can be justified in the name of ""national security"". http://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Glennon-Final.pdf  &gt;  National security policy in the United States has remained largely constant from the Bush Administration to the Obama Administration. This continuity can be explained by the ‰ÛÏdouble government‰Ûù theory of 19th-century scholar of the English Constitution Walter Bagehot. As applied to the United States  Bagehot‰Ûªs theory suggests that U.S. national security policy is defined by the network of executive officials who manage the departments and agencies responsible for protecting U.S. national security and who  responding to structural incentives embedded in the U.S. political system  operate largely removed from public view and from constitutional constraints. The public believes that the constitutionally-established institutions control national security policy  but that view is mistaken. Judicial review is negligible; congressional oversight is dysfunctional; and presidential control is nominal.  So you saw that video off the Charlie Hebdo thing  right? Here is what I saw. I'm no expert  but I have been putting in a lot of time into reading and learning how these operations work:  I saw a couple of professionals work smoothly and cleanly. They had a very well-planned out attack and made a nice escape. It certainly did not look like a couple of guys who have never seen action and suddenly self-radicalized. Even if you have trained  unless you have seen a lot of action and can control yourself  then you are going to be panicked and scattered. Those guys were smooth and in control.  Not only that  but the big tip-off to me was the leaving behind of the ID cards. This always conveniently happens. Oswald's wallet  James Earl Ray's ""bundle of evidence""  and even the passports that miraculously showed up at 9/11. It's a common tactic because it works so well on the general population and spin control through their agents in the media can discredit those who point out the absurdity.  Now what happened the next day?  Well  a couple of guys took some hostages in a bakery or something. This is where those agents who try to find people willing to become radicals come in. If you had to make something like this happen  what do you do? You probably show them that you can get them money and weapons. You probably use your knowledge of other fake acts by other agents to show them that you are connected to the terrorists. Then you tell them  ""The signal is coming. There will be an attack today  then muslims like us everywhere across Europe will stage a coordinated attack. Your mission will be to hold hostages in this bakery!"" Then they see the attack happen and believe that it is real. These aren't ever really bright people to begin with so they never figure out they are being set up. The reality is those poor patsies would have probably never had a vector to do anything at all if these agencies had never enabled them. Do you think they got those guns by themselves?  Seriously... this is how those types of things operate. You have to create an illusion like a magician. If you go and look at those JTRIG slides  that's exactly what they talk about. These guys love to compare themselves to magicians that create false realities. Examples here: https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2014/02/24/art-deception-training-new-generation-online-covert-operations/ and here: https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/  I know it sounds like madness  but we have some really famous quotes to back it up:  &gt;  William Casey  CIA Director 1981-1987: ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.‰Ûù  &gt; The aide said that guys like me were ""in what we call the reality-based community "" which he defined as people who ""believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality."" ... ""That's not the way the world really works anymore "" he continued. ""We're an empire now  and when we act  we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality‰ÛÓjudiciously  as you will‰ÛÓwe'll act again  creating other new realities  which you can study too  and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors ... and you  all of you  will be left to just study what we do."" ‰ÛÓUnnamed White House aide[1] The quote is now widely attributed to Karl Rove  This is what Karl Rove meant by ""we are history's actor's"". They are literally creating a reality of their own choosing (that of course serves themselves) for the masses to move them to the actions that they want them to.  edit:  Made a TIL post about this today.

OK  so after all that confusing explanation  this is MatPat's proposed timeline:  1. Fredbear's Family Diner Opens 2. Phone Guy kills first child  possesses the Puppet 3. Freddy Fazbear's Pizza 1st location opens- new animatronics Golden Freddy  Golden Bonnie  Bonnie  Chica  and Foxy are introduced. 4. Phone Guy develops killing pattern-using Golden Bonnie suit to lure children to backroom to their death. Kills 5 more victims. 5. Two employees die due to springlock malfunctions in Golden Freddy and Golden Bonnie suits  creating the ghostly Shadow Bonnie and Shadow Freddy. 6. Phone guy pre-records phone calls explaining how to use the springlock suits  both employee deaths incidents  and the missing children incident (FNAF 3 phonecalls). 7. The Puppet  in an attempt to give the children new life  stuff the children's bodies into Freddy  Bonnie  Chica  Foxy  and Golden Freddy suits (FNAF 2 cutscenes from perspective of Freddy animatronic; FNAF 2 GIVE LIFE minigame) 8. 1st Freddy Fazbear's shuts down due to various incidents &amp; foul odors coming off animatronics--saferoom that stores the Springtrap animatronics is permanently sealed off. 9. Grand-reopening of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza at a brand new location. 10. Phone guy kills 5 more victims using a Golden suit  prompting the Puppet to take action and attempt to have the Freddy animatronic to try and kill him (SAVE THEM minigame  FNAF2) 11. Phone guy recordings of FNAF 2 (up until Night 6 call) are pre-recorded during the summertime. 12. An investigation during the summertime occurs looking into the 5 missing children  DOES NOT SHUT DOWN new restaurant.  13. FNAF 2 begins--New Employee Jeremy Fitzgerald takes over night shift in November.  14. Phone guy MAKES PHONE CALL to Jeremy Fitzgerald (not pre-recorded!) on Night 6  explaining someone moved golden suit  that all animatronics are malfuctioning  and that there's a party they have to throw tomorrow. 15. After Night 6  Jeremy is moved to dayshift; new employee Fritz Smith takes over nightshift. 16. During the party  Mangle bites Jeremy Fitzgerald's frontal lobe (Bite of 87); Fritz Smith is fired  for the company believes he's the one who tampered with the animatronics (including Mangle). 17. The Bite of 87 causes the second location to shut down. The older animatronics  which are now deemed safer than the tampered-with newer animatronics  are sent to another location in the hopes of the restaurant one day returning. 18. Restaurant RE-OPENS AT 1ST FREDDY FAZBEAR'S PIZZA location.  19. Phone guy  who now works nightshifts  pre-records all messages for new employees. 20. Shadow Bonnie and Shadow Freddy  having died at this previous restaurant  lead the now-possessed Freddy  Bonnie  Chica  and Foxy to boarded-up saferoom  in an attempt to have Phone Guy dismantle them  releasing their spirits (FNAF 3 in-between night cutscenes). 21. Phone Guy records Night 4 phone recording while running from released spirits of the children. Hides in the Golden Bonnie suit  fails to recognize the wetness of the rained-out room  and dies in the suit as the springlocks malfunction. His spirit possesses it  but no one finds Phone Guy for years due to the room being boarded up. ((FNAF 3 in-between night cutscenes). 22. Because the Phone Guy technically is still around  the children STILL possess each animatronic in hopes to permanently finish the job. (FNAF 3 BAD ENDING) 22. FNAF 1 begins--Mike Schmidt is hired to the nightshift and listens to Phone Guy's pre-recorded messages for instructions. Is caught in the cross-fire of possessed animatronics. 23. Mike Schmidt is fired once it gets noticed that the animatronics are once again malfunctioning (he's blamed for it). Freddy Fazbear's once again shuts down. 24. FNAF 3 BEGINS- Fazbear's Fright opens 25. Phone dude finds Phone Guy's prerecorded messages for springlock suits AND Phoneguy in Golden Bonnie suit (SPRINGTRAP) 26. The puppet returns to the exhibit to finally finish the job. 27. The animatronics spirits are finally at peace and leave the suits once A. All hidden minigames are completed and B. Fazbear's Fright burns to the ground (due to the Puppet)  presumably destroying the Springtrap suit and Phone Guy with it (FNAF3 GOOD ENDING).,fivenightsatfreddys,154,01430998847,rubyeye456,The last two games were rushed because Scott was working with Universal  that's why they didn't look their best.

I totally get how busy some of you are  I hardly have time to sit down for an hour this time of year  and I know you guys have it just as bad or worse  so maybe this is a thing to think about more when summer starts and thinks (hopefully) mellow out for everyone.  When I first joined here  [these](http://i.gyazo.com/ad6992d581812ed5e05c6a4621e51d1e.png) were the mods (also the CSS was icky  props to cryo and raia) and the interacted with the community ALL the time  just on the wayback page there are 2 mod posts (albeit one a daily thread) and another trading post from darkcollector. Keich and Grumpy talked to us a lot  my experience with darkcollector was great  A11 and NotSince posted a lot more then  Cryo was always kind of reclusive I guess  Porygon-bot still sucked. Basically the mod-user interaction happened a lot more than it does now. Going through a few mods history (I know this discounts IRC  but most noobs don't use that Q_Q) I really don't see a lot more than ""don't trade this here."" etc. which is good! that kind of stuff is really important! But I definitely feel like a lot of the camaraderie that used to be here is gone. People don't really use the IRC as much (we've been having dead hour at fucking 8pm est now  wtf)  and overall the friendly atmosphere we had that distinguished us seems to be lacking.  Again  I totally get how busy people are  I'm not try to say everyone should be on the IRC 24/7  or on the DDT hanging out all day  you guys are all really swamped with real life things on top of mod things and i get that. But i feel like interacting with new (and old!) users is as important  or at least nearly as important  as doing flair apps or policing the sub  and there are some mods here that if I didn't look at the mod page I wouldn't even know they existed.   Some of you guys have real life things that are waaaaay more important than the stuff you do here  and I'm not trying to single anyone out at all. This is all just my opinion  and the opinion of the few people I've discussed it with. I think Joels words were ""It's become more of a job"" for the mods  and I think it would be more fun and more enjoyable for both sides if all this rambling shit I wrote was thought over at least a little.

You can all take this how you please. Lets talk about event farming.  It comes down to a something fairly simple we all learned while in grade school: Supply and Demand.  * First let me begin with stuff like Coro Coro Garchomp  PCBCs  PC Scizor/Gengar and Coro Coro Charizard. These events were distrubted in early XY. You had to actually order the Coro Coro magazine in order to get the code for Charizard and Garchomp. Fast Foward to right now. How often do you see Coro Charizards for trade? or better yet  a Coro Garchomp? You don't  because there are very few that exist around this place because **they were not mass farmed**. These hold a very high value. Lets say you have a PC Froakie. Thats a 1 day event in Japan. That should be pretty rare wouldn't you think? Well not really. The time PC Froakie was given out is the time (Japanese) event farming really became a problem. Now lets compare the Froakie to the Coro Coro Garchomp. You were able to get the code for Garchomp for a month or two and the period to redeem the code was also a few months long. So why is this 1 day event less value then what seems to be a fairly easy to obtain code event? There are ~7 total Coro Garchomps on the sub while there are a good 20+ PC Froakie on the sub. I can snap my fingers and have a PC Froakie in front of me in a matter of minutes  depending on what I'm offering of course but for me to find a Coro Garchomp will be much more challanging.   * Now lets see GameStop Diancie. Everyone was so happy that finally NA got an event. Some people couldn't really contain themselves. At the beginning the value of a Diancie Code was about 2-3 shinies  as time went on the value dropped and dropped and dropped. Why? Because instead of taking one or two codes and putting them up for trade  they instead advertised they had 100 codes (I'm not making this up  somebody really did have 100+ Diancie) Fast forward about a month into the distubution of Diancie. You look on the front page and all you see are threads with ""FT: Diancie Codes"".  The value has dropped from a solid 2-3 shinies to 1 shiny. Fast foward a little more  there are EVEN MORE Diancie codes! People are literally giving them away because they don't have the time to redeem themselves. The value of a single Diancie code dropped down to about 1 5IV Breedable. The supply heavily outweighed the demand.  * Hoarding: Some people don't condone this  but it can work into your advantage quite well. The perfect example of this is the Worlds Aegislash. A lot of people are aware that a large group of users from the sub all went to Worlds together with the main goal of farming this event. There are easily 50 Aegislash on this sub that have never seen a trade thread. So why does Aegislash hold such a high value still? There are so many of them! Because the people who farmed/obtained these events did not go on the sub the next day trying to trade them for anything and everything they could get their hands on. Another great example are Walmart Garchomp/Scizor. This event was given by code when you bought a copy of X or Y from Walmart in North America.  North America! There will be tons of these. Wrong! In early XY when these events were active shinies were like gold. You would see a Walmart Garchomp being traded for a mere 2-5 shinies. Something that would never happen today. Fast Foward to now. How often do you see Walmart Garchomp/Scizor for trade? Not very often. The people who grabbed these for super cheap way back in the day held on to them and waited for the DEMAND to rise.  * Now lets look at some events which *should* be rare and valuable  but really arent. Facebook Charizards is the prime example. 2000 codes in total given out  thats a really small number for the whole world right!? A handful of users made duplicate FaceBook accounts in order to get more codes. I know of one person who got 10+ codes just by themselves. So while there are only 2000 codes in the world  but lets say 400 ended up on the sub the challange for you to obtain one becomes very small. Singapore Gengar is another good example. There were 3000 codes total given out IN SINGAPORE (You actually had to be at the venue in Sinagpore to receive code paper) Myself and lots of other users thought this would be out of reach for most of us. On the day of the event 1 code showed up  people went nuts! Then another  then another  then one person had 2 codes  then 3  then 4. You get where I'm going with this. Something that was suppose to be exclusive turned into something mediocore (Mostly cause the NA Gengar was going on at the time  and the only difference was OT/ID so really only hardcore event collectors would care about that)  * /r/pokemonexchange has a very very very big effect on our event values. The amount of people selling on Exchange has tripled even in just the last month or two. I had mentioned earlier in this post that when PC Froakie/Piplup and such were active is when event farming became a real problem. I know of multiple people who got 2-3 sets themselves. Now I'm not going to tell you to not buy  I'm not going to tell you to not sell. I do it myself. Just be aware of what you are doing when asking/farming these events. PC Froakie/Piplup were 1 day each. It theory these should be worth quite a bit. 1 day  In Life  Japanese. In this case there was a very large demand but the supply still outweighed it. Same goes with Coro Rayquaza codes. Sure they are free  and the period that they hand them out is fairly long but when somebody gets 10 codes just for them alone then try to trade them all at once  you're flooding the market. If you go pick up 10 WHF Rayquazas and post a thread looking to trade them all. Same concept. ""Why are my 30 Coro Rayquaza codes worth nothing?""  * In conclusion. The main reason for this post is for the upcomming VGC Pachirisus. I know you're all excited to get your hands on something other then a Wifi Event and even expand your own collection by trading these things. Just remember one thing: Supply and Demand. The more people that farm. the less demand there will be  in turn making the value lower and lower and lower. You're not only screwing yourself out of something good but also screwing your fellow traders. If you want to make the most out of this event/experience don't go and post a thread on exchange offering reservations  don't take 8 of them and put them all for trade at once. Trade your precious rodents for something you want  don't just settle.  Thats all folks. Happy trading!",pokemontrades,16,01430929235,Rodnazics,Oh darn.

Both of these will make the job of the security services much harder.   What this will do is make peaceful non conformists  like myself  look over our shoulders to a far greater degree. As far as I am concerned :-  - I am a pacifist anyway but  even if I were not  I don't think the offensive action by our troops is doing anything to protect our country (quite the opposite).   - I refuse to give to military charities and I refuse to buy or wear a red poppy.   - I also do not support the military propaganda of parades through our streets.   - I don't believe in hereditary privilege so I am a republican. I don't wish the Royals any harm but their position is society is an anachronism in modern society. Most of the tourism is generated by the buildings and these would remain (hopefully run by the national trust).  - I don't demonstrate or seek confrontation but I am perfectly aware that I don't espouse the 'British Values' that Theresa May talks about.   - Essentially  I don't expect other people to necessarily agree with me but I value my right to free speech to be one of the awkward squad.

I work in the sector (for government  so moderately independent) in radiation protection so I get to see the good and bad side of nuclear.  The good is that it generates huge amounts of energy quite cheaply (when averaged out across power produced in its lifetime ""Levelised cost"" or ""LCOE"")  [far cheaper than most fossil fuels and some renewables](http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm). This includes all aspects of building  running  refueling and decommissioning. [It also contributes quite highly to the economy](http://www.nei.org/Master-Document-Folder/Backgrounders/Fact-Sheets/Nuclear-Power-Plants-Contribute-Significantly-to-S) providing job boosts in the surrounding areas. It's rather [safe too](http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/safety-of-nuclear-power-reactors/) as technology and design has improved it to the point where [minimal human interaction is needed in the event of necessary shutdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_nuclear_safety)  which is incredibly useful as most historic accidents have occurred due to human error. Regarding the design of nuclear plants (including safety)  a principle called [ALARP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_protection#ALARP) is applied to ensure that exposure and risk of failure is kept *as low as reasonably ~~possible~~ practicable*. These highly scrutinised criteria to ensure that the chance of an accident  and impact on public safety  are immeasurably low.  The bad  of course  is that waste can be a problem but [reprocessing](http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Fuel-Recycling/Processing-of-Used-Nuclear-Fuel/) can minimise the amount of actual waste produced  and create fuel sources for other reactor types. We also have the issue of nuclear accidents  but with safety features used in newer reactors  the chance of this happening is astronomically low. At least I hope so because I'd likely be one of the first responders in the event of an emergency! Another ""con"" that is often mentioned is the dwindling source of uranium  but this is a common misconception. Whilst it is true that there is probably only a few hundred years worth of uranium ore left in current mines  the [Japanese were experimenting with extracting naturally occurring uranium from seawater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_mining#Recovery_from_seawater). This would give Earth *billions* of years worth of uranium reserves at current usage rates  and I think the Americans recently made a breakthrough with making this process more efficient.  Overall it is an energy source with pros and cons  but what source doesn't? The pros outweigh the cons significantly in my opinion  with plants being remarkably safe now. It's carbon neutral  has potentially vast amounts of fuel sources  and provides massive amounts of energy for comparatively few sites in comparison to renewable and fossil. Personally I think the world should press on with nuclear to make it a key part of the grid in the next few years or decades  and supplement it with renewables (wind  tidal  solar  hydro  geo)  whilst pumping further funding into renewable technology and nuclear fusion for them to ideally take over grid supply in the longer term.  Sorry if this comment is a bit fragmented  I've written it very quickly during some downtime at work and I've missed out quite a bit. I'm happy to try and answer any questions that anyone might have and expand on things if you're interested  but bear in mind that I'm a relative newbie in the field (15 months) and I am specialised more in the safety and protection of nuclear sites  and accident response to an extent.

The downvote button is important. The problem with this subreddit isn't the existence of a downvote button. I realize it's just a ""trial"" but the entire idea is pointless to begin with.  The beauty of MMOs is that they appeal to gamers of many different unique tastes and preferences. Players can get satisfaction from different things.   * Some players play to collect gear/mounts/minions/titles/achievements  etc... * Some players play to simply become their in-game persona and escape from reality for a little bit. * Some players play to take on the hardest content  and love the intellectual challenge of raiding and min-maxing to push themselves to the limits.  These are just a few common examples from an infinite list of reasons to play FFXIV.  The **REAL** problem with the people on this subreddit (and MMO communities general) is **a lack of respect for players who play this game for different reasons than their own**. People will upvote content that appeals to THEIR specific tastes and they will downvote content that doesn't.   Casual players don't give a shit about hardcores min-maxing their Turn 13 strategy and don't want to see this kind of discussion taking over the subreddit. Meanwhile  hardcore players don't give a shit about commissioned artwork of your scantily clad Miqote.   As a result  content appealing to the smaller demographics get buried  even though it's a very thought-provoking and insightful discussion. Less popular demographics get neglected.  **It has become an ""us vs them"" mentality.** People see players of other demographics as an enemy who threatens THEIR enjoyment of the game  instead of friends who share a common interest. That is the REAL problem. It can't be fixed by tweaking subreddit configurations.  Taking away downvotes doesn't change anything. Popular content rises to the top. Unpopular content sinks to the bottom. Nothing changes except now people can't downvote the TRULY shitty threads like ""Plz tell me y I should buy this game lol"" that truly pollute this subreddit.  Besides  if you really want to downvote someone  you can just click their username and downvote stuff from there. Not very difficult to circumvent.  Leave the downvote alone. The ability to upvote/downvote is what makes Reddit unique and awesome. It allows people to express approval/disapproval. You're attempting to take away people's freedom to express disapproval in an attempt to serve the greater good. You don't have to read very far into your history books to realize why this is a dumb idea. If you want to take the downvote button away from all of us just to silence a few trolls  the trolls have already won.  TL;DR:  * Removing downvotes solves absolutely nothing. It only makes it slightly more inconvenient to downvote things. * Downvoting is important. It allows us to help filter incorrect information  stuff that doesn't contribute to the discussion  and overall useless fluff. * The root of the problem is that players of different demographics don't respect each other. This is a community-wide problem. Removing downvotes does not remove negativity.

These people who are stuck are dumb and should just quit!*  You can't talk about how awesome you are and then talk bad about the general player base in the same point. If you're such an exceptional player  then something like SoF **should** be easy for you. You are not the definition of the average player if you're making comments about how exceptional you are. I think it's safe to assume that SE tracks how players perform on content they release. They wouldn't nerf it if they felt the community as a whole wasn't clearing the content at the rate they were expecting.  *SE is money hungry and just wants people to pre-order Heavensward!*  No shit.

Titan either could have forfeited the last round (and the rest of the game) or forfeited overtime. Saying it isn't a forfeit is just dumb. It would have been much better to acknowledge that it was a forfeit  but turn to rule 22 instead.  At the same time  it was 1v5 and Titan acknowledged that.

Its not their style  blizzard will spend months inhouse tinkering and messing and thinking then they will release a big patch.   IMO its having a negative affect on SC aswell  from playing LOL ive come to appreciate the benefit bi monthly or monthly patches can bring to a competitive game especially one like LOL and HOTS where the meta and game benefit from constant tweaking and growth. But thats not in blizzards nature from my experience i feel they rely too much on big patches developed in house  that sometimes when released are redundant or actually bad because they are always playing catchup to the evolution of the game. In the past its lead to game stagnation  op and broken units going on seesaws from op to nerfed to pointlessness and in game metas reacting accordingly.

However  I find it hard to be grateful to the USSR  and especially to Russia as the successor of the USSR for this victory. Russians like to conveniently set the starting date of the war as June 22  1941 and to portray the conflict with Germany as a defensive war  what they call the *Great Patriotic War.* In reality  however the USSR started in on the action almost at the same time as Germany  when it was still a co-conspirator with Germany in the aggression towards Europe.  My home country of Moldova  or more exactly the region of Bessarabia  was one of the earliest victims of Russian aggression  alongside Finland  Poland  and the Baltic states. After Moldova was forcibly annexed to the USSR  its population was subjected to a brutal wave of repression. My own grandparents in fact came close to being deported to Siberia  although they benefited from an early warning and had a chance to hide during the wave of deportations. They were the lucky ones  many others in my extended family were not. The same personal story is true for millions across Eastern Europe from the families of the officers who were shot at [Katyn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre) to the purging of a large swatch of the intelligentsia of Estonia  Lithuania  and Poland.   Moreover  it's not as though the end of the war inaugurated the onset of peace and prosperity in the region either. No  what followed was yet more misery as the Soviets trapped us behind the Iron Curtain for an additional four decades. In light of these events  it's impossible for me to see the USSR as anything but yet another criminal regime that directly caused the suffering of millions alongside the Nazis. In the clash of the two totalitarian states  Nazi Germany and the Communist Soviet Union  there could be no winning for the states and peoples trapped in-between  just more or less suffering.

(PID)**  **How is it currently?** PID is illegal in Switzerland.  **What would change?**  PID would become legal in one select case: If a couple tries for artificial fertilization  they can screen the implants for genetic diseases. All other PID remains illegal -&gt; no selection for sex  no creation of rescue babies (grow stem-cell donors for siblings).  **Who proposed it?** The federal council.  **What does the parliament say?** The majority supports this amendment. There are two minority arguments against it:    * Principally opposed to PID (long term effects for society  effects for disabled people).  * To make the creation of rescue babies legal as well  **Who opposes the amendment?** Nobody major.  **Will it pass?** Probably.  **2. Scholarship initiative**  **How is it currently?** Scholarships are available through university and cantons. What you get and how much you get depends on where you live.  **What would change?** Harmonise the scholarships. The federal government would determine who would get how  much and then the cantons would pay it. And the scholarships would be increased on average to better support students.  **Who proposed it?** student organisations  **What does the parliament say?** It opposes the initiative  but agrees that the current situation is not satisfying. For this reason the parliament has proposed an alternative solution: They created a law which will sanction cantons (by withholding federal subsidies for scholar ships in that canton)  if they do not uphold the rules laid out in an earlier agreement made by the cantons among each other. This would set the minimal scholarships to 16k. This concordat is currently non-binding. The law will only come into effect if the proposal is rejected.   **Who opposes the amendment?** Government (too much centralization  unnecessary with current situation  additional costs)  **Will it pass?** Probably not.  **3.  Million-Inheritance tax to support welfare state**  **How is it currently?** Currently there is no federal inheritance tax.  **What would change?** A federal inheritance tax would be implemented. Anyone could deduct 2 million from the tax  anything beyond that is taxes 20%. The income of this tax would be used by 2/3 to bolster the social retirement fund (AHV) and 1/3 would be awarded to the cantons. This tax would replace all cantonal inheritance taxes.  **Who proposed it?** Four political parties: SP (socialist democrats)  EVP (evangelical party)  GP (green socialist)  SGB (Swiss Trade Union Association (one of several)).  **Who opposes the amendment?** All the other parties.  **What does the parliament say?** They oppose it  since they believe the cantonal   **Arguments for:** fair and useful  small and medium inheritances are better protected  the parliament has enough wiggle room to protect family businesses  better AHV.  **Arguments against:** More centralization  harder for family business inheritance  not enough to save AHV  no difference in tax for closer relatives  the new law would be applied retro-actively until 2012  weaken Switzerland's stand in the international competition.   **Will it pass?** Probably not. Initiatives from the left opposed by the economy almost never pass.  **4.  Reform for national TV/Radio**  **How is it currently?** If you own a TV/Radio you have to pay a fee. This fee is collected by Billag  one of the most disliked/hated companies in Switzerland. The fee is 462 CHF annually.  **What would change?** The fee would be replaced by an universal  but lower fee. Every house-hold would have to pay 400 CHF a year. Additionally corporations with a yearly revenue of 500'000 and more would have to pay a fee as well.  **Who proposed it?** This is a law that was created by the federal council and passed by both parliaments. Now a group of people has gathered 50'000 signatures for a referendum against the law.  **Who opposes the law?** A bunch of people (mostly centre liberal business types)  **What does the parliament say?** Is in support since the current situation is bad and outdated.   **Arguments for:** Current system is outdated and with a lot of administrative cost. New system is simpler: Everyone pays. Lower fee. Nobody watches national TV illegally anymore.  **Arguments against:** Corporations pay double. The public service is not accurately defined the fee goes towards funding bullshit TV. No longer a fee but a tax. The federal council can adjust the number without having to change the law.  **Will it pass?** Probably.

Step by step this is how the business plan would look like:  Research phase:  1. First of all go to local hardware shops in your area - slightly higher quality ones and also if possible try and speak to builders / real estate construction guys to see if there's a market for these more premium door handles in your city.  2. Try to get a feel for what some of these ""premium"" brass door handles look like and how they are different from the Rs. 200 - 500 bracket regular door handles or aldrops. You will develop an eye for this over time as you browse competitor websites and supplier images etc. For eg www.victorylocks.com http://www.dorsetindia.com/ - For suppliers go to www.alibaba.com and type ""brass door handles"" or ""pull handles""  3. Learn about the different categories of these door handles which are mainly: Pull Handles (used in offices / restaurants on glass doors usually)  Mortice Handles (used in homes and the biggest seller)  Handle on Rose (horizontal handles)  Handle on Plate (vertical handles)  Main Door Handle (larger designer pull handles used in premium / rich class homes for their main door)  Once you have done this research and feel comfortable knowing the product type and can tell what is a ""premium"" door handle and what is a regular one  you will have a good idea of what kind of handles to source from your supplier. To make things simple just try and copy the inventory of this guy: www.decolocks.com  Business Set Up phase  1. Decide a brand name  logo and all that jazz. ""Diamond Locks"" or whatever you like. Set up a cheap website for now just to make the brand appear legit and established.  2. Get this business registered as a private limited company - nobody will take you seriously if you go to clients offices accepting payments in your personal savings account. ;) There are sites that offer this whole pvt. ltd registration service at like Rs 5 000 to Rs 10 000 - get it done.  3. You should already have an idea of a few good suppliers from Alibaba.com but now is the time when you really need to lock on one supplier and finalize a ""sample order"". Here's one that I use: laotongjiang.en.alibaba.com / http://laotongjiang.en.alibaba.com/productgrouplist-222097622/Brass_Door_Handles.html  4. Finalize your first import order from China - this is more like a ""sample"" order to get your business started. Choose like 10 to 20 different door handle designs you want to  sell initially and order 10 sets of each. This is going to be the biggest start up expense and this first sample order will cost you around 2 lacs more or less.  5. Google for a ""freight forwarder"" or similar company in India. Here's one I use: http://www.seatransmovers.com/ These guys take all the hassle out of importing and will take care of all the paper work etc and import the door handles safely for you from China.   - Just a word of advice: Importing from China is a bit of a skill in itself  negotiation etc matters a bit and you will learn this along the way.   My friend's dad barely knows any English but he is a damn good negotiator and knows Chinese people like the back of his hand by now. Remember  as the buyer YOU are in power and these Chinese exporters will be eager to please you as long as you appear like a ""big"" guy to them. Promise big orders in the future etc.  - Once the first lot of door handles from China arrives  get your product catalog printed and also product packaging with your own branding printed. This is more important than you think. You want to really invest in a very premium looking product catalog / brochure because this is what your clients will see in meetings for the first time. Also your product packaging must look good.  The catalog has pictures of all of your door handles that you just imported from China and things like a company profile page etc all presented as beautifully as possible. The catalog should feel like you are a million dollar company manufacturing brass door handles in a big facility somewhere in your town.  The whole premise of this business is appearing like a legit manufacturer of premium brass door handles and not letting clients know the fact you import them from China. This is not cheating or anything  its just how white label brands operate. Karbonn Mobile etc all are basically doing the same thing in a different industry.  - Once your catalog  business card etc is ready - its time to step into the battle field. Either you personally or you and some friends act as salespersons for your own firm  visit hardware shops  hardware dealers / distributors / wholesalers - offer them sample pieces  give them your catalog - meet with them - tell them you manufacture premium brass door handles for high end apartments  buildings  offices  hospitals etc.  This is the most crucial step of this entire operation and I could write an essay on this step alone but you get the idea... you have to go out there and do the sales.. build customers  give them free sample pieces if you have to.  This product does sell fast - once you build customers you will just grow naturally from there.  So to sum it up:  1. Research your local door handle market 2. Set up business legally as a pvt ltd firm  get logo  catalog and shit done 3. Import first set of door handles from Chinese supplier. 4. Repackage these door handles into your own branded boxes. 5. Go out there and meet with builders  real estate guys  construction guys  hardware shops  hardware distributors etc - in short the SALES part.",india,185,11431490228,rcha,Not sure why Many Indians are not aware of it. 1971 war is almost led to WW3  .people should reading more these kind of wars where geopolitics and true colors of some nations is on display . ,india,189,01431500811,RajaRajaC,Ok and?

Both cost money. There is a common argument against renting that somehow renting is ""throwing money away"" and that paying a mortgage is all about building up equity.   First  a mortgage payment is heavily skewed to the interest portion in the beginning part of your mortgage. So if you get a 30 year mortgage and plan to move in a few years  there will be little to no build up of equity through mortgage payments. And with most Americans moving every 6-8 years  there is a high chance that you will not have the time to build up that equity. Then there is also the fact that all of the other costs associated with owning a house - property taxes  insurance  repairs  normal maintenance  emergency fixes  etc - is not going to build up equity and is also being ""thrown away"" in the sense of no capital buildup. Even things like needing new appliances are not going to raise the value of your house much  because a normal home buyer expects there to be working appliances and would simply discount your house if there were none.   However  it still may be cheaper to buy a place and set aside enough money each month to pay for the extra costs of repairs  maintenance  property taxes  etc than it is to rent. The opposite may also be true. You can check out the [NY Times Buy Vs Rent tool](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) and play with the factors including property prices  rent prices  length of time in home  interest rates  downpayment  etc. It will take into account opportunity costs - the ability to have used the money you would put towards the house to other investment opportunities. This is often where the calculus tips towards renting.  Another reason we often advise people who come here to rent is because of other financial stress. If you don't have a proper emergency fund  you are setting yourself up for financial stress and failure. There is no more landlord to fix the main pipe that burst so you need to be prepared to deal with that. If you don't even have a downpayment  where you will be able to get the money to replace the roof? Obviously not through a HELOC and if you can't save before buying a house  it is likely you won't be able to save after buying a house.  There are other reasons as well  including the need for mobility and expected upcoming life changes. Tying yourself down at a time when you need the flexibility to up and move for that amazing career opportunity is self-sabotage.  The short version is that it may be financially imprudent to buy a house because of the rent versus buy calculations  capital requirements  or lifestyle choices.  Now onto the car argument. If you buy a used car or if you lease a new car you are getting the same good  namely transportation. That is where the comparison with housing stops. Because after 3 years with a lease  you turn it in and get another  larger payment for a new lease (inflation and all). Rinse and repeat forever. Now with a used car  once you pay it off  it is yours. Since you can pay off a used car in a usually short amount of time and the car should still have many years of life  you drive around sans car payment for quite a while  which you will never do while leasing. A used car has gone through the largest depreciation period already and will hold its value much better.   With a lease - always have a car payment. With a used car - get to car payment free rather quickly.  Now  if we are talking about new cars  the numbers change. Some people will always want a new car. If your plan is to buy a new car every three years or so  then lease.

I never heard of it before but it does make sense.   *Someone care to explain how I'm wrong? ,personalfinance,-61,01431693990,AcquaPiovana,"I hope I don't get buried.  Former bank employee  current financial worker  and former homeless  street rat here.  I hope I can help.  1) You need ID.  Do you have a current photo ID?  If not  please get one.  Have a secondary form of ID  too  if possible.  Birth certificate  SSN card  anything govt issued.  2) If you're unsure how much debt is taxes or city/government-based  I would advise *against* putting this check in a bank under your identity.  The account could get frozen in as few as two business days  and you will probably never see that money again.  3) It is difficult (near impossible) to cash a check of that amount if you're not a current account holder at any bank  even with proper ID.  You can definitely try to cash it at the bank it's drawn on  but make sure you have ID up the wazoo  and a small branch may ask you to come back another day if they don't have the reserves to give out that much at one time.  Also  you then have the issue of where the F to put this money.  This might sound crazy  but if you do successfully get this money in cash  you might want an old fashioned suitcase-type thing with a combo lock.  I think Staples sells stuff like this.  4) I would advise that you then flip the money into a cashier's check made out to yourself  but this gets messy too  as many banks have fraud policies in place that state they only draft bank checks for customers.  As previously stated  you probably don't (and shouldn't) have a bank account in your name at this time.  5) Do you have someone in your life you trust  infinitely?  You mention signing it over to someone else.  This is potentially the best option  as long as the person helping you is the most trustworthy person known to man.  You are  almost literally  trusting them with your life.    What you would do is: accompany this friend/family member to *their* bank (not the bank the check is drawn on).  Walk up to a teller together.  Present ID.  State that you are endorsing the check over to the other person  and he/she is depositing it in their bank account.  The fact that you're *there* will alleviate any red flags for the teller  who is almost definitely not going to find any of this sketchy or throw up alarm bells.  It would be different if you *weren't* there  and this account holder showed up trying to deposit a $20k check in someone else's name which was simply double endorsed.  That could result in extended holds  and research.  Then  wait for the funds to be verified by the bank and the money to become available.  (Side note: I hope this friend of yours banks at a big bank like B of A  because this will make things easier for you down the road... *edit for clarity* if you're leaving town  I mean... having checks for a small three-location bank will be almost just as useless as your huge check  if you leave the area).  THEN I would go back to the bank and have this friend request a series of bank checks in your name  then give you a certain amount in cash (a couple thousand?).  The bank checks keep your money safe while giving you control.  If lost  they can be replaced (keep the carbon receipts!!!).  They can't be cashed by anyone else.  You may also want to drop some money onto a pre-paid master card  which visually resembles and operates like a debit card.  You *DON'T* need to supply visa/mastercard/amex with your SSN in order to maintain one of these types of cards.  Be warned: this type of money-movement will result in paying fees.  There will be fees to get the checks in the first place  fees to cash them later if you're not an account holder  and fees to maintain one of those silly pre-paid cards.  But these are your limitations in going off the grid.  6) As someone else said  I would get the F out of NYC  as your money will last longer elsewhere.  Like  almost anywhere else you go.  Pre-paid rent (though ill-advised by someone else) might be required since you don't have proof of a job or references  probably.  But see if you can pre-pay for as little as possible.  Three months?  Five months?  7) Be frugal with anything you buy  because this amount of money can seem like a lot  but will go fast.  Buy used stuff  get a small apartment  eat at cheap places  conservative cell phone plan  etc.    8) While still keeping your working money (the $20k) off the grid  once you're established somewhere  begin contacting lenders and saying you are ready and willing to make some arrangements  but you still have no job.  Make sure you have a mailing address and email account to keep in contact with them to keep your promises.    9) Enjoy the job search.  Waiting tables might be good?  Data entry?  Again  I would consider something outside of NYC (possibly out of NY entirely  to get as much lag-time on city-based debt as possible).    Most of all: good luck.  *edit:* I didn't expect so many kind words towards me  of all people.  Thanks reddit  you're cool today.  I want to add one more thing:  I didn't strongly address the addiction or mention rehab for a few reasons.  But overall  I'm giving OP the benefit of the doubt because the post suggests a conscientious move towards changing his/her life and taking control.  I agree that getting a fist full of cash as an addict is not the best idea  and my post is not meant to advocate that.  I wanted to give realistic solutions to put this money in the hands of the person it belongs to to improve his/her life  because I know what it's like to be at the bottom and feel like  even when good stuff happens to you  you get roadblocked at every turn.  Therefore  if /u/cantcountnoaccount has the correct info about a Bellevue detox and 28 day rehab having no up-front cost  then **DO IT**.  Checks don't typically go stale (""expire"" for lack of a better word) in a month  but OP should definitely check any clause on the check that states ""valid for ____ days"" or the like.  Some checks have clauses as few as 90 days.  If the check does not explicitly state that it goes stale in a set amount of time  the general rule is 1 year for a ""corporate"" or company check  and 6 months for a personal check.

Or you can go to the probate court and see if they have volunteer attorneys who handle these matters. 1. it is true that you are not liable for any debts of your mother.  Your mother's estate will be liable for her debts.  Do not sign any paperwork that has anything regarding your financial liability.  Do not agree to undertake any of the costs of your mother's treatment.   2.  Get yourself to a social security office and apply for benefits if your sister is still a minor. 3. Essentially the debts for your mother's hospital stay will be wiped in the estate.  It's too late to apply for COBRA benefits as someone else suggested.  See if the hospital has a financial ombudsman  but don't sign any paperwork unless you have an attorney review it first.   3.Credit card companies  and many utilities have debt forgiveness programs  but unless you are a co-signor on any of your Mother's debts they can only collect against the assets of the Estate anyway. Also  these programs are run by particular departments/individuals within each organization  so the average customer service representative is just wasting your time.    4. If you don't have access to funds to hire an attorney  you can try to probate the estate yourself.  There is a learning curve  but its not impossible  or for that matter particularly difficult.  The difficulty lies in not understanding the terminology and the process  not some secret law tricks only lawyers have access to.  There are many law books and help from webpages you can research.   5. Many districts have statutory fees that a lawyer can receive for probating an estate.  You should find out what fees are normal in your area before you agree to be represented. 6.  If you and your sister are living in your mother's home you want to prioritize payment of the mortgage and utilities.  It is very hard to get out from under foreclosure proceedings  and much more costly in the long run to let those bills fall to the estate's responsibility and have to dig your way out  than it is to maintain the status quo  if possible.  Also paying the household bills is arguably a ""loan"" to the estate  which also makes you a creditor to the estate.  Therefore  keep meticulous records of any expenses you do pay.   7.Never pay the credit card debts  they are unsecured  and sit at the bottom of the debts paid out by the probate court.  Ignore all the hospital bills (they'll be coming several months after the hospital stay)  except as a debt of the Estate.   8.  In my state  debts of the estate are paid as follows: Funeral Bill  Attorney's fees  Fiduciary fees (the executor gets paid for his work)  Taxes  Secured creditors  unsecured creditors  heirs  9. It is possible you will be forced to sell the house to settle the estate if there is not enough cash/assets to pay the debts.  Don't let that freak you out at the moment.  In my state the court has a nine month window from the opening of an estate to the closing  and that window can be extended many times.   If you are in the situation where the house is at risk of being sold in order to settle the estate  and you and your sister are staying at the house  then worry the more about maintaining your own good credit than paying the mortgage.   10. Call the pension administrator.  There may be terms under the pension for this situation that will allow it to transfer to you or your sister.  There may be a death payout that would help you over the hump. 11.  When dealing with any institution do not leave them an original death certificate unless they require it.  Always ask them to keep a copy of your certificate instead.  Get at least 3 but no more than 5 copies of the certified death certificate when you first get them.  Usually the funeral home will ask you how many copies you want.  Later  if you need more copies you will go to the appropriate agency to get them (city hall  probate court  it differs from place to place)  9edit commas for clarity  additional advice)  Sorry for your loss  I hope some of my information helps you out.",personalfinance,3250,31432758215,strugglingcomic,Very  very sorry for your loss. I offer you my condolences  but since you are here  I think you are more interested in practical advice.  1) Try to stay as calm as you can. Since you are in charge of finances  you should be aware of any and all outstanding debts and obligations  as well as assets. Being able to evaluate your situation calmly and logically will be invaluable to you and your children. Do not make any rash decisions now (i.e. don't try to sell your house immediately or something like that).  2) Your top and immediate focus is on the basic necessities. You need a roof over your heads  food on the table  and to handle funeral expenses  that sort of thing. Do not worry about making investments or even reporting income for taxes just yet. You still have many months to work out those details later. Whatever money you have coming to you in the next few weeks  park it in your savings accounts and don't touch it for anything other than absolute necessities. Pay your rent or mortgage on time  pay your utilities  get the groceries  and pay off or minimize your high interest debts.   3) Make sure you have a support network for you and your children  relatives or close friends who you trust absolutely and who you can delegate some tasks to. Don't be afraid to reach out for help  including professional help such as a grief counselor or therapist for you and your children. Your mental and emotional well being is just as important (if not more so) as your financial well-being.  4) A few months down the road  sit down and plan out more of your financial future. Either hire an accountant or do some research about how you plan to use the money available to you  and what your tax obligations look like. But you do not have to worry about this right now  you seem to be in decent shape financially and should be fine to put your finances into a holding pattern for the next few months. But keep in mind  you will need to find stable full-time employment by then as well  once you feel ready for it.   I know my words must seem tiny and insignificant compared to what you're facing right now. But please understand that you are not helpless  you can do this  and you can take care of your family going forward. It won't be easy  and of course it won't be the same  but it is far from hopeless or insurmountable. Take it all at your own pace: one breath  one step  one day at a time.,personalfinance,2635,41432833473,HerpDeeps,"File a police report.  Contact the credit bureaus to report fraud and give them a copy of the report.  I hate to tell you this  but the truth is that this can be very difficult if you ever intend to borrow money in the future for a car / house.  On the bright side  if you are under 18  then I believe none of the credit transactions are enforceable anyway.

He fucked up big time and over the past couple years  has fucked himself deeper and harder and continues to do so. Tapping out  going back home to reassess  and trying living independently again is nothing to be embarrassed of.

Companies will try to make you think you have to pay the debts of your loved ones. Some of them are very persuasive and even threatening. Simply tell them to fuck off.,personalfinance,1448,0
